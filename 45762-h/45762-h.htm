<h2><a name="EDITORS_NOTE" id="EDITORS_NOTE">EDITOR'S NOTE.</a></h2>


<p>The existence of any children's tradition in America, maintained independently
of print, has hitherto been scarcely noticed. Yet it appears
that, in this minor but curious branch of folk-lore, the vein in the United
States is both richer and purer than that so far worked in Great Britain.
These games supply material for the elucidation of a subject hitherto
obscure: they exhibit the true relation of ancient English lore of this
kind to that of the continent of Europe; while the amusements of youth
in other languages are often illustrated by American custom, which compares
favorably, in respect of compass and antiquity, with that of European
countries.</p>

<p>Of the two branches into which the lore of the nursery may be divided&mdash;the
tradition of children and the tradition of nurses&mdash;the present collection
includes only the former. It is devoted to formulas of play which
children have preserved from generation to generation, without the intervention,
often without the knowledge, of older minds. Were these&mdash;trifling
as they often are&mdash;merely local and individual, they might be
passed over with a smile; but being English and European, they form not
the least curious chapter of the history of manners and customs. It has
therefore been an essential part of the editor's object to exhibit their
correspondences and history; but, unwilling to overcloud with cumbrous
research that healthy and bright atmosphere which invests all that really
belongs to childhood, he has thought it best to remand to an appendix
the necessary references, retaining in the text only so much as may be
reasonably supposed of interest to the readers in whom one or another
page may awaken early memories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>He has to express sincere thanks to the friends, in different parts of the
country, whose kind assistance has rendered possible this volume, in which
almost every one of the older states is represented; and he will be grateful
for such further information as may tend to render the collection more
accurate and complete.</p>

<p>The melodies which accompany many of the games have been written
from the recitation of children by S. Austen Pearce, Mus. Doc. Oxon.</p>

<h3>I.<br />

<i>THE DIFFUSION AND ORIGIN OF AMERICAN GAME-RHYMES.</i></h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The hideous Thickets in this place<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were such that Wolfes and Beares nurst up their
young from the eyes of all beholders in those very places where the streets are full of
Girles and Boys sporting up and downe, with a continued concourse of people."&mdash;"Wonder-working
Providence in New England," 1654.</p>

<p>"The first settlers came from England, and were of the middle rank, and chiefly Friends. * * *
In early times weddings were held as festivals, probably in imitation of such a practice
in England. Relations, friends, and neighbors were generally invited, sometimes to
the amount of one or two hundred. * * * They frequently met again next day; and
being mostly young people, and from under restraint, practised social plays and sports."&mdash;Watson's
"Account of Buckingham and Solebury" (Pennsylvania; settled about 1682).</p></div>

<p>A majority of the games of children are played with rhymed formulas,
which have been handed down from generation to generation. These we
have collected in part from the children themselves, in greater part from
persons of mature age who remember the usages of their youth; for this
collection represents an expiring custom. The vine of oral tradition, of
popular poetry, which for a thousand years has twined and bloomed on
English soil, in other days enriching with color and fragrance equally
the castle and the cottage, is perishing at the roots; its prouder branches
have long since been blasted, and children's song, its humble but longest-flowering
offshoot, will soon have shared their fate.</p>

<p>It proves upon examination that these childish usages of play are almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>entirely of old English origin. A few games, it is true, appear to have
been lately imported from England or Ireland, or borrowed from the
French or the German; but these make up only a small proportion of the
whole. Many of the rounds still common in our cities, judging from their
incoherence and rudeness, might be supposed inventions of "Arabs of the
streets;" but these invariably prove to be mere corruptions of songs long
familiar on American soil. The influence of print is here practically
nothing; and a rhyme used in the sports of American children almost
always varies from the form of the same game in Great Britain, when
such now exists.</p>

<p>There are quarters of the great city of New York in which one hears
the dialect, and meets the faces, of Cork or Tipperary. But the children
of these immigrants attend the public school, that mighty engine of equalization;
their language has seldom more than a trace of accent, and they
adopt from schoolmates local formulas for games, differing more or less
from those which their parents used on the other side of the sea. In
other parts of the town, a German may live for years, needing and using
in business and social intercourse no tongue but his own, and may return
to Europe innocent of any knowledge of the English speech. Children
of such residents speak German in their homes, and play with each other
the games they have brought with them from the Fatherland. But they
all speak English also, are familiar with the songs which American children
sing, and employ these too in their sports. There is no transference
from one tongue to another, unless in a few cases, when the barrier of
rhyme does not exist. The English-speaking population, which imposes
on all new-comers its language, imposes also its traditions, even the traditions
of children.</p>

<p>A curious inquirer who should set about forming a collection of these
rhymes, would naturally look for differences in the tradition of different
parts of the Union, would desire to contrast the characteristic amusements
of children in the North and in the South, descendants of Puritan and
Quaker. In this he would find his expectations disappointed, and for the
reason assigned. This lore belongs, in the main, to the day before such
distinctions came into existence; it has been maintained with equal pertinacity,
and with small variations, from Canada to the Gulf. Even in
districts distinguished by severity of moral doctrines, it does not appear
that any attempt was made to interfere with the liberty of youth. Nowhere
have the old sports (often, it is true, in crude rustic forms) been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
more generally maintained than in localities famous for Puritanism.
Thus, by a natural law of reversion, something of the music, grace, and
gayety of an earlier period of unconscious and natural living has been
preserved to sweeten the formality, angularity, and tedium of an otherwise
beneficial religious movement.</p>

<p>It is only within the century that America has become the land of motion
and novelty. During the long colonial period, the quiet towns, less
in communication with distant settlements than with the mother-country
itself, removed from the currents of thought circulating in Europe, were
under those conditions in which tradition is most prized and longest maintained.
The old English lore in its higher branches, the ballad and the tale,
already belonging to the past at the time of the settlement, was only sparingly
existent among the intelligent class from which America was peopled;
but such as they did bring with them was retained. Besides, the
greater simplicity and freedom of American life caused, as it would
seem, these childish amusements to be kept up by intelligent and cultivated
families after the corresponding class in England had frowned them
down as too promiscuous and informal. But it is among families with
the greatest claims to social respectability that our rhymes have, in general,
been best preserved.</p>

<p>During the time of which we are writing, independent local usages
sprang up, so that each town had oftentimes its own formulas and names
for children's sports; but these were, after all, only selections from a
common stock, one place retaining one part, another, of the old
tradition. But in the course of the last two generations (and this is a secondary
reason for the uniformity of our games in different parts of the
country) the extension of intercourse between the States has tended to
diffuse them, so that petty rhymes, lately invented, have sometimes
gained currency from Maine to Georgia.</p>

<p>We proceed to speak of our games as they exist on the other side of the
sea. A comparison with English and Scotch collections shows us very few
games mentioned as surviving in Great Britain which we cannot parallel
in independent forms. On the other hand, there are numerous instances
in which rhymes of this sort, still current in America, do not
appear to be now known in the mother-country, though they oftentimes
have equivalents on the continent of Europe. In nearly all such cases it
is plain that the New World has preserved what the Old World has forgotten;
and the amusements of children to-day picture to us the dances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which delighted the court as well as the people of the Old England before
the settlement of the New.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>To develop the interest of our subject, however, we must go beyond the
limits of the English tongue. The practice of American children enables
us to picture to ourselves the sports which pleased the infancy of
Froissart and Rabelais.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A dramatic action of the Virginia hills preserves
the usage of F&auml;r&ouml;e and Iceland, of Sweden and Venice.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We discover
that it is an unusual thing to find any remarkable childish sport
on the European continent which failed to domesticate itself (though now
perhaps forgotten) in England. It is thus vividly and irresistibly forced
upon our notice, that the traditions of the principal nations of Europe
have differed little more than the dialects of one language, the common
tongue, so to speak, of religion, chivalry, and civilization.</p>

<p>A different explanation has been given to this coincidence. When only
the agreement, in a few cases, of English and German rhymes was noticed,
it was assumed that the correspondence was owing to race-migration;
to the settlement in England of German tribes, who brought with them
national traditions. The present volume would be sufficient to show the
untenability of such an hypothesis. The resemblance of children's songs in
different countries, like the similarity of popular traditions in general, is
owing to their perpetual diffusion from land to land; a diffusion which
has been going on in all ages, in all directions, and with all degrees of
rapidity. But the interest of their resemblance is hardly diminished by
this consideration. The character of some of these parallelisms proves
that for the diffusion in Europe of certain games of our collection we
must go back to the early Middle Age;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> while the extent of the identity
of our American (that is, of old English) child's lore with the European
is a continual surprise.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Internal evidence alone would be sufficient to refer many of the sports
to a medi&aelig;val origin, for we can still trace in them the expression of the
life of that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>We comprehend how deeply medi&aelig;val religious conceptions affected
the life of the time, when we see that allusions to those beliefs are still
concealed in the playing of children. We find that the tests which the
soul, escaped from the body, had, as it was supposed, to undergo&mdash;the scales
of St. Michael, the keys of St. Peter, and the perpetual warfare of angels
and devils over departed souls&mdash;were familiarly represented and dramatized
in the sports of infants.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Such allusions have, it is true, been excluded
from English games; but that these once abounded with them can be
made abundantly evident. We see that chivalric warfare, the building
and siege of castles, the march and the charge of armies, equally supplied
material for childish mimicry. We learn how, in this manner, the social
state and habits of half a thousand years ago unconsciously furnish the
amusement of youth, when the faith and fashion of the ancient day is no
longer intelligible to their elders.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that many of the game-rhymes in this collection
were not composed by children. They were formerly played, as in many
countries they are still played, by young persons of marriageable age, or
even by mature men and women. The truth is, that in past centuries all
the world, judged by our present standard, seems to have been a little
childish. The maids of honor of Queen Elizabeth's day, if we may credit
the poets, were devoted to the game of tag,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and conceived it a waste of
time to pass in idleness hours which might be employed in that pleasure,
with which Diana and her nymphs were supposed to amuse themselves.
Froissart describes the court of France as amusing itself with sports familiar
to his own childhood; and the <i>Spectator</i> speaks of the fashionable
ladies of London as occupied with a game which is represented in
this series.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>We need not, however, go to remote times or lands for illustration
which is supplied by New England country towns of a generation since.
In these, dancing, under that name, was little practised; it was confined to
one or two balls in the course of the year on such occasions as the Fourth
of July, lasting into the morning hours. At other times, the amusement
of young people at their gatherings was "playing games." These games
generally resulted in forfeits, to be redeemed by kissing, in every possible
variety of position and method. Many of these games were <i>rounds</i>; but
as they were not called dances, and as mankind pays more attention to
words than things, the religious conscience of the community, which objected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>to dancing, took no alarm. Such were the pleasures of young men
and women from sixteen to twenty-five years of age. Nor were the participants
mere rustics; many of them could boast as good blood, as careful
breeding, and as much intelligence, as any in the land. Neither was the
morality or sensitiveness of the young women of that day in any respect
inferior to what it is at present.</p>

<p>Now that our country towns are become mere outlying suburbs of
cities, these remarks may be read with a smile at the rude simplicity of
old-fashioned American life. But the laugh should be directed, not at our
own country, but at the by-gone age.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In respectable and cultivated
French society, at the time of which we speak, the amusements, not merely
of young people, but of their elders as well, were every whit as crude.
The suggestion is so contrary to our preconceived ideas, that we hasten
to shelter ourselves behind the respectable name of Madame Celnart, who,
as a recognized authority on etiquette, must pass for an unimpeachable
witness.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This writer compiled a very curious "Complete Manual of
Games of Society, containing all the games proper for young people of
both sexes," which seems to have gained public approbation, since it
reached a second edition in 1830. In her preface she recommends the
games of which we have been speaking as recreations for <i>business men</i>:</p>

<p>"Another consideration in favor of games of society: it must be admitted
that for persons leading a sedentary life, and occupied all day in
writing and reckoning (the case with most men), a game which demands
the same attitude, the same tension of mind, is a poor recreation. * * * On
the contrary, the varying movement of games of society, their diversity,
the gracious and gay ideas which these games inspire, the decorous caresses
which they permit&mdash;all this combines to give real amusement. These
caresses can alarm neither modesty nor prudence, since a kiss in honor
given and taken before numerous witnesses is often an act of propriety."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>She prefers "rounds" to other amusements: "All hands united; all
feet in cadence; all mouths repeating the same refrain; the numerous
turns, the merry airs, the facile and rapid pantomime, the kisses which
usually accompany them&mdash;everything combines, in my opinion, to make
rounds the exercise of free and lively gayety."</p>

<p>We find among the ring-games given by our author, and recommended
to men of affairs, several of which English forms exist in our collection,
and are familiar to all children.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We are thus led to remark an important truth. It is altogether a mistake
to suppose that these games (or, indeed, popular lore of any description)
originated with peasants, or describe the life of peasants. The tradition,
on the contrary, invariably came from above, from the intelligent
class. If these usages seem rustic, it is only because the country retained
what the city forgot, in consequence of the change of manners to which it
was sooner exposed. Such customs were, at no remote date, the pleasures
of courts and palaces. Many games of our collection, on the other hand,
have, it is true, always belonged to children; but no division-line can
be drawn, since out of sports now purely infantine have arisen dances
and songs which have for centuries been favorites with young men and
women.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<i>THE DANCE, THE BALLAD, AND THE GAME.</i></h3>

</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Canadian Round.</i></p>

<p>Games accompanied by song may be divided into ballads, songs, and
games proper.</p>

<p>By the term ballad is properly signified a dance-song, or dramatic poem
sung and acted in the dance. The very word, derived through the late
Latin<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from the Greek, attests that golden chain of oral tradition which
links our modern time, across centuries of invasion and conflict, with
the bright life of classic antiquity.</p>

<p>Still more pleasantly is a like history contained in another name for
the same custom. The usual old English name for the round dance, or its
accompanying song, was <i>carol</i>, which we now use in the restricted sense
of a festival hymn. Chaucer's "Romaunt of the Rose" describes for us
the movement of the "karole," danced on the "grene gras" in the spring
days. He shows us knights and ladies holding each other by the hand, in
a flowery garden where the May music of mavis and nightingale blends
with the "clere and ful swete karoling" of the lady who sings for the
dancers. This sense of the word continued in classic use till the sixteenth
century, and has survived in dialect to the present day. Many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>games of our series are such rounds or carols, "love-dances" in which
youths and maidens formerly stood in the ring by couples, holding each
other's hands, though our children no longer observe that arrangement.
Now the word <i>carol</i> is only a modernized form of <i>chorus</i>. Thus childish
habit has preserved to the present day the idea and movement of the village
ring-dance, the chorus, such as it existed centuries or millenniums before
another and religious form of the dance accompanied by song had
received that technical name in the Greek drama.</p>

<p>Very little was needed to turn the ballad into a dramatic performance,
by assigning different parts to different actors. It is natural also for
children to act out the stories they hear. We find, accordingly, that
ancient ballads have sometimes passed into children's games. But, in
the present collection, the majority of the pieces which can be referred
to the ballad are of a different character. In these the remainder of the
history is reduced to a few lines, or to a single couplet. These <i>historiettes</i>
have retained the situation, omitting the narration, of the ancient song.
We can understand how youthful or rustic minds, when the popular song
had nearly passed out of mind, should have vaguely maintained the upshot
of the story:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here sits the Queen of England in her chair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has lost the true love that she had last year.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is the tragedy told in a line; and what more is needed, since an excuse
is already provided for the kiss or the romp?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Of lyric song we have scarce anything to offer. The fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries gave birth, all over Europe, to popular lyric poesy,
modelled on literary antecedents, and replacing in general estimation the
ancient dramatic ballad. Shakespeare, who merely refers to the ballad
proper, makes frequent use of the popular song of his day. In many
countries this taste has penetrated to the people; the power of lyric composition
has become general, so that a collection of popular songs will contain
many sweet and pleasing pieces. The ballad has thus passed into the
<i>round</i>. An inconsequent but musical babble, like that of a brook or a
child, has replaced the severe accents of the ancient narration. But in
English&mdash;why, we will not pause to inquire&mdash;it is not so. Whatever of
this kind once existed has passed away, leaving but little trace. All that
is poetical or pretty is the relic of past centuries; and when the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>treasure is spent, absolute prose succeeds. The modern soil is incapable
of giving birth to a single flower.</p>

<p>Our rhymes, therefore, belong almost entirely to the third class&mdash;the
game proper. But though less interesting poetically, and only recorded
at a late period, it does not follow that they have not as ancient a history
as the oldest ballads; on the contrary, it will abundantly appear that the
formulas used in games have an especially persistent life. As the ballad
is a dramatic narrative, so the game is a dramatic action, or series of actions;
and the latter is as primitive as the former, while both were employed
to regulate the dance.</p>

<p>Most modern dances, silently performed in couples, are merely lively
movements; but in all ancient performances of the sort the idea is as essential
as the form. Precisely as the meaningless refrains of many ballads
arise from a forgetfulness of intelligible words, dances which are only
motion grew out of dances which expressed something. The dance was
originally the dramatized expression of any feature of nature or life which
excited interest. Every department of human labor&mdash;the work of the
farmer, weaver, or tradesman; the church, the court, and the army; the
habits and movements of the animals which seem so near to man in his
simplicity, and in whose life he takes so active an interest; the ways and
works of the potent supernatural beings, good or evil, or, rather, beneficent
or dangerous, by whom he believes himself surrounded; angel and devil,
witch and ogre&mdash;representations of all these served, each in turn, for the
amusement of an idle hour, when the labor which is the bitterness of the
enforced workman is a jest to the free youth, and the introduction of
spiritual fears which constitute the terror of darkness only adds an agreeable
excitement to the sports of the play-ground. All this was expressed
in song shared by the whole company, which was once the invariable attendant
of the dance, so that the two made up but one idea, and to "sing
a dance" and "dance a song" were identical expressions.</p>

<p>The children's rounds of to-day, in which each form of words has its
accompanying arrangement of the ring, its significant motion and gesture,
thus possess historic interest. For these preserve for us some picture of
the conduct of the ballads, dances, and games which were once the amusement
of the palace as of the hamlet.</p>

<p>The form of the verses used in the games also deserves note. These
usually consist either of a rhyming couplet, or of four lines in which the
second and fourth rhyme; they are often accompanied by a refrain, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
may be a single added line, or may be made up of two lines inserted into
the stanza; and in place of exact consonance, any assonance, or similarity
of sound, will answer for the rhyme. Above all, they possess the freedom
and quaintness, the tendency to vary in detail while preserving the general
idea, which distinguish a living oral tradition from the monotonous
printed page; in these respects, our rhymes, humble though they be, are
marked as the last echo of the ancient popular poetry.</p>

<p>There is especial reason why an Englishman, or the descendants of
Englishmen, should take pride in the national popular song.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> European
medi&aelig;val tradition was, it is true, in a measure a common stock; but,
though the themes may often have been thus supplied, the poetic form
which was given to that material in each land was determined by the
genius of the language and of the people. Now, among all its neighbors,
the English popular poesy was the most courtly, the most lyric, the most
sweet. So much we can still discern by what time has spared.</p>

<p>The English ballad was already born when Canute the Dane coasted
the shore of Britain; its golden age was already over when Dante summed
up medi&aelig;val thought in the "Divina Commedia;" its reproductive period
was at an end when Columbus enlarged the horizon of Europe to admit a
New World; it was a memory of the past when the American colonies
were founded; but even in its last echoes there lingers we know not
what mysterious charm of freshness, poetic atmosphere, and eternal youth.
Even in these nursery rhymes some grace of the ancient song survives.
A girl is a "red rose," a "pretty fair maid," the "finest flower," the
"flower of May." The verse itself, simple as it is, often corrupted, is a
cry of delight in existence, of satisfaction with nature; its season is the
season of bloom and of love; its refrain is "For we are all so gay." It
comes to us, in its innocence and freshness, like the breath of a distant and
inaccessible garden, tainted now and then by the odors of intervening city
streets. But the vulgarity is modern, accidental; the pleasure and poetry
are of the original essence.</p>

<p>We cannot but look with regret on the threatened disappearance of
these childish traditions, which have given so much happiness to so many
generations, and which a single age has nearly forgotten. These songs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>have fulfilled the conditions of healthy amusement, as nothing else can
do. The proper performance of the round, or conduct of the sport, was to
youthful minds a matter of the most serious concern&mdash;a little drama which
could be represented over and over for hours, in which self-consciousness
was absorbed in the ambition of the actors to set forth properly their parts.
The recital had that feature which distinguishes popular tradition in
general, and wherein it is so poorly replaced by literature. Here was no
repetition by rote; but the mind and heart were active, the spirit of the
language appropriated, and a vein of deep though childish poetry nourished
sentiment and imagination. It seems a thousand pities that the ancient
tree should not continue to blossom; that whatever may have been
acrid or tasteless in the fruit cannot be corrected by the ingrafting of a
later time. There is something so agreeable in the idea of an inheritance
of thought kept up by childhood itself, created for and adapted to its own
needs, that it is hard to consent to part with it. The loss cannot be made
good by the deliberate invention of older minds. Children's amusement,
directed and controlled by grown people, would be neither childish nor
amusing. True child's play is a sacred mystery, at which their elders can
only obtain glances by stealth through the crevice of the curtain. Children
will never adopt as their own tradition the games which may be composed
or remodelled, professedly for their amusement, but with the secret purpose
of moral direction.</p>

<p>We do not mean, however, to sigh over natural changes. These amusements
came into existence because they were adapted to the conditions of
early life; they pass away because those conditions are altered. The taste
of other days sustained them; the taste of our day abandons them. This
surrender is only one symptom of a mighty change which has come over
the human mind, and which bids fair to cause the recent time, a thousand
years hence, to be looked back upon as a dividing-mark in the history
of intelligence. If it should turn out that the childhood of the human
intellect is passing gradually into the "light of common day"&mdash;if the
past is to be looked back upon with that affectionate though unreasoning
interest with which a grown man remembers his imaginative youth&mdash;then
every fragment which illustrates that past will possess an attraction independent
of its intrinsic value.</p>

<span class="i0">Through gladness of this lovely May.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Old Song.</i></p>

<p>Children's rhymes and songs have been handed down in two principal
ways. First, they have been used for winter amusements, particularly
at the Christmas season,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as has from time immemorial been the case in
northern countries; and, secondly, they have been sung as rounds and
dances, especially during summer evenings, upon the village green or city
sidewalk. The latter custom is fast becoming extinct, though the circling
ring of little girls "on the green grass turning" may now and then be
still observed; but a generation since the practice was common with all
classes. The proper time for such sports is the early summer; and many
of our rounds declare themselves in words, as well as by sentiment, to be
the remainder of the ancient May dances. To render this clear, it will be
necessary to give some account of the May festival; but we shall confine
ourselves to customs of which we can point out relics in our own land.
These we can illustrate, without repeating the descriptions of English
writers, from Continental usage, which was in most respects identical with
old English practice.</p>

<p>It was an ancient habit for the young men of a village, on the eve of
the holiday, to go into the forests and select the tallest and straightest tree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>which could be found. This was adorned with ribbons and flowers,
brought home with great ceremony, and planted in front of the church,
or at the door of some noted person, where it remained permanently
to form the centre of sports and dances. The May-pole itself, the songs
sung about it, and the maiden who was queen of the feast, were alike
called <i>May</i>. In the absence of any classic mention, the universality of the
practice in medi&aelig;val Europe, and the common Latin name, may be taken
as proof that similar usages made part of the festival held about the calends
of May&mdash;the <i>Floralia</i> or <i>Majuma</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been said about the license of this festival
in the days of the Empire, it is altogether probable that the essential character
of the feast of Flora or Maia was not very different from its medi&aelig;val
or modern survival. The abundance of flowers, the excursions to the
mountains, the decoration of houses, and the very name of Flora, prove
that, whatever abuses may have introduced themselves, and whatever primitive
superstitions may have been intermingled&mdash;superstitions to an early
time harmless and pure, and only in the decline of faith the source of
offence and corruption&mdash;the population of ancient Italy shared that natural
and innocent delight in the season of blossom which afterwards affected
to more conscious expression Chaucer and Milton.</p>

<p>This "bringing home of summer and May" was symbolic; the tree,
dressed out in garlands, typifying the fertility of the year. As in all such
rites, the songs and dances, of a more or less religious character, were
supposed to have the power of causing the productiveness which they extolled
or represented.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> These practices, however, were not merely superstitious;
mirth and music expressed the delight of the human heart, in its
simplicity, at the reappearance of verdure and blossom, and thanksgiving
to the generous Bestower, which, so long as man shall exist on earth, will
be instinctively awakened by the bright opening of the annual drama.
Superstition has been the support about which poetry has twined: it is
a common mistake of investigators to be content with pointing out
the former, and overlooking the coeval existence of the latter. Thus
the natural mirth and merriment of the season blended with the supposed
efficacy of the rite; and the primitive character of the ring-dance
appears to be the circle about the sacred tree in honor of the period of
bloom.</p>

<p>A relic, though a trifling one, of the ancient custom, may be seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>some of our cities on the early days of the month. In New York, at
least, groups of children may then be observed carrying through the
streets a pole painted with gay stripes, ribbons depending from its top,
which are held at the end by members of the little company. These proceed,
perhaps, to the Central Park, where they conduct their festivities,
forming the ring, and playing games which are included in our collection.
Within a few years, however, these afternoon expeditions have become
rare.</p>

<p>The May-pole, as we have described it, belonged to the village; but a
like usage was kept up by individuals. It was the duty of every lover to
go into the woods on the eve or early morn of May-day, and bring thence
boughs and garlands, which he either planted before the door of his mistress,
or affixed thereto, according to local custom. The particular tree, or
<i>bush</i> (this expression meaning no more than bough), preferred for the purpose
was the hawthorn, which is properly the tree of May, as blooming in
the month the name of which it has in many countries received. A belief
in the protective influence of the <i>white-thorn</i>, when attached to the
house-door, dates back to Roman times. The May-tree, whatever its species,
was often adorned with ribbons and silk, with fruit or birds, sometimes
with written poems. The lover brought his offering at early dawn,
and it was the duty of his mistress to be present at her window and receive
it; thus we have in a song of the fifteenth or sixteenth century from
the Netherlands&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair maiden, lie you still asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And let the morning go?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise, arise, accept the May,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That stands here all a-blow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An English carol alludes to the same practice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A branch of May I bring to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before your door it stands.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The custom was so universal as to give rise to proverbial expressions.
Thus, in Italy, "to plant a May at every door" meant to be very susceptible;
and in France, to "esmayer" a girl was to court her.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may be surprised to learn that an offshoot of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>usage still exists in the United States; the custom, namely, of hanging
"May baskets." A half-century since, in Western Massachusetts, a lad
would rise early on May-morning, perhaps at three o'clock, and go into
the fields. He gathered the trailing arbutus (the only flower there available
at the season), and with his best skill made a "basket," by the aid
of "winter-green" and similar verdure. This he cautiously affixed to the
door of any girl whom he wished to honor. She was left to guess the
giver. The practice is still common in many parts of the country, but in
a different form. Both boys and girls make "May baskets," and on May-eve
attach them to each other's doors, ringing at the same time the house-bell.
A pursuit follows, and whoever can capture the responsible person
is entitled to a kiss. We do not venture to assert that the latter usage is
entirely a corruption of the former.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The term "May-baskets" is no doubt a modernized form of the old
English word "May-buskets," employed by Spenser.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <i>Buskets</i> are no
more than <i>bushes</i>&mdash;that is, as we have already explained, the flowering
branches of hawthorn or other tree, picked early on the May-morn, and
used to decorate the house. It seems likely that a misunderstanding of
the word changed the fashion of the usage; the American lad, instead of
attaching a bough, hung a basket to his sweetheart's door.</p>

<p>A French writer pleasantly describes the customs of which we are
speaking, as they exist in his own province of Champagne: "The hours
have passed; it is midnight; the doors of the young lads open. Each
issues noiselessly. He holds in his hand branches and bouquets, garlands
and crowns of flowers. Above the gate of his mistress his hand, trembling
with love, places his mysterious homage; then, quietly as he came,
he retires, saying, 'Perhaps she has seen me.' ... The day dawns. Up!
boys and girls! up! it is the first of May! up, and sing! The young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>men, decked out with ribbons and wild-flowers, go from door to door to
sing the month of May and their love."</p>

<p>Of the morning song and dance about the "bush," or branches of trees
planted as we have described, we have evidence in the words of American
rhymes. Thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As we go round the <i>mulberry-bush</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>All on a frosty morning</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In one or two instances, a similar refrain figures in the childish sports of
little girls, who have probably got it by imitation; in others, it is the sign
of an old May game.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> An English writer of the sixteenth century alludes
to the morning dance in a way which proves that these songs really represent
the practice of his time.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The playing of May games was by no means confined to the exact date
of the festival. The sign of a country tavern in England was a thorn-bush
fixed on a pole, and about this "bush" took place the dance of wedding
companies who came to the tavern to feast, whence this post was called
the <i>bride's stake</i>. Whether the thorn-bush was introduced into the "New
English" settlements we cannot say; but the dancing at weddings was common,
at least among that portion of those communities which was not
bound by the religious restraint that controlled the ruling class. There
were, as a French refugee wrote home in 1688, "all kinds of life and
manners" in the colonies. In the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, 7th May,
1651, the General Court resolved, "Whereas it is observed that there are
many abuses and disorders by dauncinge in ordinaryes, whether mixt or
unmixt, upon marriage of some persons, this court doth order, that henceforward
there shall be no dauncinge upon such occasion, or at other times,
in ordinaryes, upon the paine of five shillings, for every person that shall
so daunce in ordinaryes." While youth in the cities might be as gay as
elsewhere, in many districts the Puritan spirit prevailed, and the very
name of dancing was looked on with aversion. But the young people met
this emergency with great discretion; they simply called their amusements
<i>playing games</i>, and under this name kept up many of the rounds which
were the time-honored dances of the old country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The French writer whom we have already had occasion to quote goes
on to speak of the customs of the younger girls of his province&mdash;the
<i>bachelettes</i>, as they are called. "On the first of May, dressed in white,
they put at their head the sweetest and prettiest of their number. They
robe her for the occasion: a white veil, a crown of white flowers adorn
her head; she carries a candle in her hand; she is their queen, she is the
<i>Trimouzette</i>. Then, all together, they go from door to door singing the
song of the <i>Trimouzettes</i>; they ask contributions for adorning the altar
of the Virgin, for celebrating, in a joyous repast, the festival of the Queen
of Heaven."</p>

<p>This May procession, which has been the custom of girls for centuries,
from Spain to Denmark, existed, perhaps still exists, in New England.
Until very recently, children in all parts of the United States maintained
the ancient habit of rising at dawn of May-day, and sallying forth in
search of flowers. The writer well remembers his own youthful excursions,
sometimes rewarded, even in chilly Massachusetts, by the early blue
star of the hepatica, or the pink drooping bell of the anemone. The
maids, too, had rites of their own. In those days, troops of young girls
might still be seen, bareheaded and dressed in white, their May-queen
crowned with a garland of colored paper. But common-sense has prevailed
at last over poetic tradition; and as an act of homage to east winds, a
hostile force more powerful at that period than the breath of Flora, it has
been agreed that summer in New England does not begin until June.</p>

<p>These May-day performances, however, were originally no children's
custom; in this, as in so many other respects, the children have only
proved more conservative of old habit than their elders. There can be no
doubt that these are the survivals of the ancient processions of Ceres,
Maia, Flora, or by whatever other name the "good goddess," the patroness
of the fertile earth, was named, in which she was solemnly borne forth
to view and bless the fields. The queen of May herself represents the
mistress of Spring; she seems properly only to have overlooked the games
in which she took no active part.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>A writer of the fifteenth century thus describes the European custom
of his day: "A girl adorned with precious garments, seated on a chariot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>filled with leaves and flowers, was called the queen of May; and the girls
who accompanied her as her handmaidens, addressing the youths who
passed by, demanded money for their queen. This festivity is still preserved
in many countries, especially Spain." The usage survives in the
dolls which in parts of England children carry round in baskets of flowers
on May-day, requesting contributions.</p>

<p>Of this custom a very poetical example, not noticed by English collectors,
has fallen under our own observation. We will suppose ourselves
in Cornwall on May-day; the grassy banks of the sunken lanes are gay
with the domestic blooms dear to old poetry; the grass is starry with pink
and white daisies; the spreading limbs of the beech are clad in verdure,
and among the budding elms of the hedge-rows "birds of every sort"
"send forth their notes and make great mirth." A file of children, rosy-faced
boys of five or six years, is seen approaching; their leader is discoursing
imitative music on a wooden fife, to whose imaginary notes the
rest keep time with dancing steps. The second and third of the party
carry a miniature ship; its cargo, its rigging, are blooms of the season,
bluebells and wall-flowers; the ship is borne from door to door, where
stand the smiling farmers and their wives; none is too poor to add a
penny to the store. As the company vanishes at the turn of the lane,
we feel that the merriment of the children has more poetically rendered
the charm of the season than even the song of the birds.</p>

<p>There is in America no especial song of the festival, though children
at the May parties of which we have spoken still keep up the "springing
and leaping" which medi&aelig;val writers speak of as practised by them at
this occasion. Popular songs are, however, still remembered in Europe,
where their burden is, May has come! or, Welcome to May! Pleasing
and lyric is the song of the "Trimazos," the lay of the processions of
girls to which we have alluded, though its simplicity becomes more formal
in our version of the provincial French:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is the merry month of May, Winter has taken flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not keep my heart at home that bounded for delight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I went, and as I came, I sang to the season gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the May, the merry May, the merry month of May!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">E'en as I came the meadows by, the wheat-fields have I seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hawthorn branches all a-flower, the oat-fields growing green;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O Trimazos!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the May, the merry May, the merry month of May!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Madam, I thank you for your coin, and for your courtesy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is for Mary and her Babe, and it is not for me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will pray the Child for you to whom your gift is given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he return it you again more royally in heaven.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So, in the Vosges, young girls fasten a bough of laurel to the hat of a
young man whom they may meet on the way, wishing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That God may give him health and joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love that he loves best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the May, the lovely May.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They ask a gift, but not for themselves:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It shall be for the Virgin Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So good and so dear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the May, the lovely May.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Corresponding to the French song from which we have quoted is the
English May carol, similarly sung from dwelling to dwelling:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rise up the mistress of this house, with gold along your breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the summer springs so fresh, green, and gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if your body be asleep, we hope your soul's at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drawing near to the merry month of May.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God bless this house and harbor, your riches and your store,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the summer springs so fresh, green, and gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We hope the Lord will prosper you, both now and evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drawing near to the merry month of May.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The frequent allusions of the earlier English poets to "doing May observance,"
or the "rite of May," show us how all ranks of society, in their
time, were still animated by the spirit of those primitive faiths to which
we owe much of our sensibility to natural impressions. Milton himself,
though a Puritan, appears to approve the usages of the season, and even
employs the ancient feminine impersonation of the maternal tenderness
and bounty of nature, invoking the month:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The flow'ry May, who from her green lap throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mirth and youth, and warm desire;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Woods and groves are of thy dressing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus we salute thee with our early song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcome thee, and wish thee long.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Time, and the changes of taste, have at last proved too strong for the
persistency of custom; the practices by which blooming youth expressed
its sympathy with the bloom of the year have perished, taking with them
much of the poetry of the season, and that inherited sentiment which was
formerly the possession of the ignorant as well as of the cultivated class.</p>

<h3>IV.<br />

<i>THE INVENTIVENESS OF CHILDREN.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the days of childhood new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Time had years and ours were few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on grassy fields at play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran we this, the other way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this very meadow-ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First violets found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the cattle graze to-day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Minnesinger, 13th Century.</i></p>

<p>The student of popular traditions is accustomed to recognize the most
trifling incidents of a tale, or the phrases of a song, as an adaptation of
some ancient or foreign counterpart, perhaps removed by an interval of
centuries. It is the same with rhymes of the sort included in this collection,
in which formulas of sport, current in our own day and in the New
World, will be continually found to be the legacy of other generations
and languages. Should we then infer that childhood, devoid of inventive
capacity, has no resource but mechanical repetition?</p>

<p>We may, on the contrary, affirm that children have an especially lively
imagination. Observe a little girl who has attended her mother for an
airing in some city park. The older person, quietly seated beside the
footpath, is half absorbed in revery; takes little notice of passers-by, or
of neighboring sights or sounds, further than to cast an occasional glance
which may inform her of the child's security. The other, left to her own
devices, wanders contented within the limited scope, incessantly prattling
to herself; now climbing an adjoining rock, now flitting like a bird from
one side of the pathway to the other. Listen to her monologue, flowing
as incessantly and musically as the bubbling of a spring; if you can catch
enough to follow her thought, you will find a perpetual romance unfolding
itself in her mind. Imaginary personages accompany her foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>steps;
the properties of a childish theatre exist in her fancy; she sustains
a conversation in three or four characters. The roughnesses of the ground,
the hasty passage of a squirrel, the chirping of a sparrow, are occasions
sufficient to suggest an exchange of impressions between the unreal
figures with which her world is peopled. If she ascends, not without a
stumble, the artificial rockwork, it is with the expressed solicitude of a
mother who guides an infant by the edge of a precipice; if she raises her
glance to the waving green overhead, it is with the cry of pleasure exchanged
by playmates who trip from home on a sunshiny day. The older
person is confined within the barriers of memory and experience; the
younger breathes the free air of creative fancy.</p>

<p>A little older grown, such a child becomes the inventor of legend.
Every house, every hill in the neighborhood, is the locality of an adventure.
Every drive includes spots already famous in supposed history, and
passes by the abodes of fancied acquaintances. Into a land with few traditions
the imagination of six years has introduced a whole cycle of
romance.</p>

<p>If the family or vicinity contains a group of such minds, fancy takes
outward form in dramatic performance. The school history is vitalized
into reality; wars are waged and battles performed in a more extended
version, while pins and beans signify squadrons and regiments. Romances
are acted, tales of adventure represented with distribution of r&ocirc;les.
Thus, in a family of our acquaintance, the children treasured up wood-engravings,
especially such as were cut from the illustrated journals:
runaway horses, Indian chiefs, and trappers of the wilderness were at an
especial premium. These they stored in boxes, encamped in different
corners of the room, and performed a whole library of sensational tales.
A popular piece set forth the destruction of the villain of the story by a
shark, while navigating a <i>catamaran</i>. The separated beds of the sleeping-room
represented the open planks of the raft; the gentlest and most compliant
character personified the malefactor; and the shark swam between
the bedsteads.</p>

<p>Where sports require or allow such freedom, the ingenuity of children
puts to shame the dulness of later years, and many a young lady of twenty
would find it impossible to construct the dialogue which eight summers
will devise without an effort. It was a favorite amusement of two girls
just entering their teens to conduct a boarding-school. The scholars and
the teachers of the imaginary school were all named, and these characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
were taken in dialogue by the little actors, each sustaining several perfectly
well-defined parts. The pupils pursued their pleasures and their studies
according to their several tastes; while their progress, their individual accomplishments
and offences, were subsequently gravely discussed by the
instructors, and the condition, prospects, and management of the institution
talked over. Thus, hour after hour, without hesitation or weariness, the
conversation proceeded, with the duo of friends for actors and audience!</p>

<p>Oftentimes, with young children, an outward support is required for
fancy, an object to be mentally transformed. One set of little girls collected
in the fall birch-leaves, changed to yellow, out of which alone they
created their little nursery. Another party employed pins, which they inserted
in a board, and called pin-fairies. By the aid of these, long dramatizations
were performed, costumes devised, and palaces decorated, under
regulations rigidly observed.</p>

<p>Such exercises of imagination are usually conducted in strict privacy,
and unremarked, or not understood, by parents; but when the attention
of the latter is directed to these performances, they are often astonished
by the readiness they disclose, and are apt to mistake for remarkable talent
what is only the ease of the winged fancy of youth, which flies lightly
to heights where later age must laboriously mount step by step.</p>

<p>As infancy begins to speak by the free though unconscious combination
of linguistic elements, so childhood retains in language a measure of
freedom. A little attention to the jargons invented by children might
have been serviceable to certain philologists. Their love of originality
finds the tongue of their elders too commonplace; besides, their fondness
for mystery requires secret ways of communication. They therefore often
create (so to speak) new languages, which are formed by changes in the
mother-speech, but sometimes have quite complicated laws of structure,
and a considerable arbitrary element.</p>

<p>The most common of these, which are classified by young friends under
the general name of <i>gibberish</i>, goes in New England by the name of
"Hog Latin." It consists simply in the addition of the syllable <i>ery</i>, preceded
by the sound of hard <i>g</i>, to every word. Even this is puzzling to
older persons, who do not at first perceive that "Wiggery youggery goggery
wiggery miggery" means only "Will you go with me!" Children
sometimes use this device so perpetually that parents fear lest they may
never recover the command of their native English. When it ceases to
give pleasure, new dialects are devised. Certain young friends of ours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
at first changed the termination thus&mdash;"Withus yoovus govus withus meevus?"
which must be answered, "Ivus withus govus withus yoovus;" the
language, seemingly, not admitting a direct affirmative. The next step
was to make a more complicated system by prefixing a <i>u</i> (or <i>oo</i>) sound
with a vowel suffix. Thus, "Will you go with me to lunch?" would be
"Uwilla uoa ugoa uwitha umea utoa uluncha?" But this contrivance,
adopted by all the children of a neighborhood,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was attended with variations
incapable of reduction to rule, but dependent on practice and instinct.
The speech could be learned, like any other, only by experience;
and a little girl assured us that she could not comprehend a single word
until, in the course of a month, she had learned it by ear. She added, in
regard to a particular dialect, that it was much harder than French, and
that her brother had to think a great deal when he used it. The application
of euphonic rules was more or less arbitrary. Thus, <i>understand</i>
would be <i>uery-uinste</i>. The following will answer for a specimen of a
conversation between a child and a nurse who has learned the tongue:
"Uery uisy uemy uity?" "Up-stairs, on the screen in your room."
The child had asked, "Where is my hat?"</p>

<p>A group of children living near Boston invented the <i>cat language</i>, so
called because its object was to admit of free intercourse with cats, to
whom it was mostly talked, and by whom it was presumed to be comprehended.
In this tongue the cat was naturally the chief subject of nomenclature;
all feline positions were observed and named, and the language
was rich in such epithets, as Arabic contains a vast number of expressions
for <i>lion</i>. Euphonic changes were very arbitrary and various, differing for
the same termination; but the adverbial ending <i>ly</i> was always <i>osh</i>; <i>terribly</i>,
<i>tirriblosh</i>. A certain percentage of words were absolutely independent,
or at least of obscure origin. The grammar tended to Chinese or
infantine simplicity; <i>ta</i> represented any case of any personal pronoun.
A proper name might vary in sound according to the euphonic requirement
of the different Christian-names by which it was preceded. There
were two dialects, one, however, stigmatized as <i>provincial</i>.</p>

<p>This invention of language must be very common, since other cases
have fallen under our notice in which children have composed dictionaries
of such.</p>

<p>It would be strange if children who exhibit so much inventive talent
did not contrive new games; and we find accordingly that in many families
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>a great part of the amusements of the children are of their own devising.
The earliest age of which the writer has authentic record of such ingenuity
is two and a half years.</p>

<p>Considering the space which our Indian tribes occupy in the imagination
of young Americans, it is remarkable that the red man has no place
whatever in the familiar and authorized sports. On the other hand, savage
life has often furnished material for individual and local amusements.</p>

<p>Near the country place of a family within our knowledge was a patch
of brushwood containing about forty acres, and furnishing an admirable
ground for savage warfare. Accordingly, a regular game was devised.
The players were divided into Indians and hunters, the former uttering
their war-cry in such dialect as youthful imagination regarded as aboriginal.
The players laid ambushes for each other in the forest, and the game ended
with the extermination of one party or the other. This warfare was
regulated by strict rules, the presentation of a musket at a fixed distance
being regarded as equivalent to death.</p>

<p>In a town of Massachusetts, some thirty years since, it was customary
for the school-girls, during recess, to divide themselves into separate tribes.
Shawls spread over tent-poles represented Indian lodges, and a girl always
resorted to her allotted habitation. This was kept up for the whole
summer, and carried out with such earnestness that girls belonging to hostile
tribes, though otherwise perfectly good friends, would often not speak
to each other for weeks, in or out of school.</p>

<p>In the same town was a community of "Friends," or "Quakers." It
was the custom for children of these to play at meeting. Sitting about
the room on a "First-day" gathering, one of them would be moved by the
spirit, rise, and exhort in the sing-song tone common to the meeting-house.
There was a regular formula for this amusement&mdash;a speech which
the children had somewhere heard and found laughable: "My de-ar
friends, I've been a thinking and a thinking and a thinking; I see the
blinking and the winking; pennyroyal tea is very good for a cold."</p>

<p>A young lady of our acquaintance, as a child, invented a game of
pursuit, which she called Spider and Fly. The Flies, sitting on the
house-stairs, buzzed in and out of the door, where they were exposed to
the surprise of the Spider. The children of the neighborhood still maintain
the sport, which is almost the exact equivalent of a world-old game
whose formula is given in our collection.</p>

<p>We need not go on to illustrate our thesis. But it remains true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the great mass of the sports here presented are not merely old, but have existed
in many countries, with formulas which have passed from generation
to generation. How are we to reconcile this fact with the quick invention
we ascribe to children?</p>

<p>The simple reason why the amusements of children are inherited is
the same as the reason why language is inherited. It is the necessity of
general currency, and the difficulty of obtaining it, which restricts the variation
of one and of the other. If a sport is familiar only to one locality
or one set of children, it passes away as soon as the youthful fancy of that
region grows weary of it. Besides, the old games, which have prevailed
and become familiar by a process of natural selection, are usually better
adapted to children's taste than any new inventions can be; they are
recommended by the quaintness of formulas which come from the remote
past, and strike the young imagination as a sort of sacred law. From
these causes, the same customs have survived for centuries through all
changes of society, until the present age has involved all popular traditions,
those of childhood as of maturity, in a general ruin.</p>

<h3>V.<br />

<i>THE CONSERVATISM OF CHILDREN.</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, as girl's duty is, Timarete lays down her cymbals,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Places the ball that she loved, carries the net of her hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maiden, and bride to be, her maids<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to maid Artemis renders,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with her favorites too offers their various wardrobe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Greek Anthology.</i></p>

<p>As the light-footed and devious fancy of childhood, within its assigned
limits, easily outstrips the grave progress of mature years, so the obedience
of children is far more scrupulous not to overstep the limits of the
path. It is a provision of nature, in order to secure the preservation of
the race, that each generation should begin with the unquestioning reception
of the precepts of that which it follows. No deputy is so literal, no
nurse so Rhadamanthine, as one child left in charge of another. The
same precision appears in the conduct of sports. The formulas of play
are as Scripture, of which no jot or tittle is to be repealed. Even the inconsequent
rhymes of the nursery must be recited in the form in which
they first became familiar; as many a mother has learned, who has found
the versions familiar to her own infancy condemned as inaccurate, and
who is herself sufficiently affected by superstition to feel a little shocked,
as if a sacred canon had been irreligiously violated.</p>

<p>The life of the past never seems so comprehensible, and the historic
interval never so insignificant, as when the conduct and demeanor of
children are in question. Of all human relations, the most simple and
permanent one is that of parent and child. The loyalty which makes a
clansman account his own interests as trifling in comparison with those
of his chieftain, or subjects consider their own prosperity as included in
their sovereign's, belongs to a disappearing society; the affection of the
sexes is dependent, for the form of its manifestation, on the varying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>usages of nations; but the behavior of little children, and of their parents
in reference to them, has undergone small change since the beginnings of
history. Homer might have taken for his model the nursery of our own
day, when, in the words of Achilles' rebuke to the grief of Patroclus, he
places before us a Greek mother and her baby&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Patroclus, why dost thou weep, like a child too young to speak plainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A girl who runs after her mother, and cries in arms to be taken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catching hold of her garment, and keeping her back from her errand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking up to her tearful, until she pauses and lifts her?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the passage is almost too familiar to cite&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hector the radiant spoke, and reached out his arms for the baby;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the infant cried out, and hid his face in the bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his nurse gayly-girdled, fearing the look of his father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scared by the gleam of the bronze, and the helmet crested with horse-hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreading to see it wave from the lofty height of the forehead.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same manner, too, as the feelings and tastes of children have
not been changed by time, they are little altered by civilization, so that
similar usages may be acceptable both to the cultivated nations of Europe
and to the simpler races on their borders.</p>

<p>It is natural, therefore, that the common toys of children should be
world-old. The tombs of Attica exhibit dolls of classic or ante-classic
time, of ivory or terra-cotta, the finer specimens with jointed arms or legs.
Even in Greece, as it seems, these favorites of the nursery were often
modelled in wax; they were called by a pet name, indicating that their
owners stood to them in the relation of mamma to baby; they had their own
wardrobes and housekeeping apparatus. The Temple of Olympian Zeus
at Elis contained, says Pausanias, the little bed with which Hippodamia
had played. But the usage goes much further back. Whoever has seen
the wooden slats which served for the cheaper class of the dolls of ancient
Egypt, in which a few marks pass for mouth, nose, and eyes, will have no
difficulty in imagining that their possessors regarded them with maternal
affection, since all the world knows that a little girl will lavish more tenderness
on a stuffed figure than on a Paris doll, the return of affection
being proportional to the outlay of imagination.</p>

<p>When Greek and Roman girls had reached an age supposed to be superior
to such amusements, they were expected to offer their toys on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
altar of their patroness, to whatever goddess might belong that function,
Athene or Artemis, Diana or Venus Libitina. If such an act of devotion
was made at the age of seven years, as alleged, one can easily understand
that many a child must have wept bitterly over the sacrifice. To this
usage refers the charming quatrain, a version of which we have set as
the motto of our chapter.</p>

<p>Children's rattles have from the most ancient times been an important
article of nursery furniture. Hollow balls containing a loose pebble,
which served this purpose, belong to the most ancient classic times.
These "rattles," however, often had a more artistic form, lyre-shaped with
a moving plectrum; or the name was used for little separate metallic figures&mdash;"charms,"
as we now say&mdash;strung together so as to jingle, and worn
in a necklace. Such were afterwards preserved with great care; in the
comic drama they replace the "strawberry mark" by which the father
recognizes his long-lost child. Thus, in the "Rudens" of Plautus, Pal&aelig;stra,
who has lost in shipwreck her casket, finds a fisherman in possession
of it, and claims her property. Both agree to accept D&aelig;mones, the unknown
father of the maiden, as arbiter. D&aelig;mones demands, "Stand off,
girl, and tell me, what is in the wallet?" "Playthings."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "Right, I see
them; what do they look like?" "First, a little golden sword with letters
on it." "Tell me, what are the letters?" "My father's name. Then
there is a two-edged axe, also of gold, and lettered; my mother's name is
on the axe.... Then a silver sickle, and two clasped hands, and a little
pig, and a golden heart, which my father gave me on my birthday." "It
is she; I can no longer keep myself from embracing her. Hail, my
daughter!"</p>

<p>In the ancient North, too, children played with figures of animals.
The six-year-old Arngrim is described in a saga as generously making a
present of his little brass horse to his younger brother Steinolf; it was
more suitable to the latter's age, he thought.</p>

<p>The weapons of boys still preserve the memory of those used by primitive
man. The bow and arrow, the sling, the air-gun, the yet more
primeval club or stone, are skilfully handled by them. Their use of the
top and ball has varied but little from the Christian era to the present day.
It is, therefore, not surprising that many games are nearly the same as
when Pollux described them in the second century.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Yet it interests us
to discover that not only the sports themselves, but also the words of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>the formulas by which they are conducted, are in certain cases older than
the days of Plato and Xenophon.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>We have already set forth the history contained in certain appellations
of the song and dance. If the very name of the <i>chorus</i> has survived in
Europe to the present day, so the character of the classic round is perpetuated
in the ring games of modern children. Only in a single instance,
but that a most curious one, have the words of a Greek children's round
been preserved. This is the "tortoise-game," given by Pollux, and we
will let his words speak for themselves:</p>

<p>"The <i>tortoise</i> is a girl's game, like the <i>pot</i>; one sits, and is called <i>tortoise</i>.
The rest go about asking:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O torti-tortoise, in the ring what doest thou?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I twine the wool, and spin the fine Milesian thread."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tell us, how was it that thy offspring died?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which she says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He plunged in ocean from the backs of horses white."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our author does not tell us how the game ended; but from his comparison
to the "pot-game"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> we conclude that the tortoise immediately
dives into the "ocean" (the ring) to catch whom she can.</p>

<p>This quaint description shows us that the game-formulas of ancient
times were to the full as incoherent and obscure as those of our day frequently
are. The alliterative name of the tortoise,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> too, reminding us of
the repetitions of modern nursery tales, speaks volumes for the character
of Greek childish song.</p>

<p>Kissing games, also, were as familiar in the classic period as in later
time; for Pollux quotes the Athenian comic poet Crates as saying of a
coquette that she "plays kissing games in rings of boys, preferring the
handsome ones."</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that we can offer nothing so graceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>as the cry with which Greek girls challenged each other to the race, an
exclamation which we may render, "Now, fairies!"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>&mdash;the maidens assuming
for the nonce the character of the light-footed nymphs of forest or
stream.</p>

<p>Coming down to medi&aelig;val time, we find that the poets constantly
refer to the life of children, with which they have the deepest sympathy,
and which they invest with a bright poetry, putting later writers to shame
by comparison. That early period, in its frank enjoyment of life, was
not far from the spirit of childhood. Wolfram of Eschenbach represents
a little girl as praising her favorite doll:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None is so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As my daughter there.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The German proverb still is "Happy as a doll."</p>

<p>It has been remarked how, in all times, the different sex and destiny
of boys and girls are unconsciously expressed in the choice and conduct of
their pleasures. "Women," says a writer of the seventeenth century,
"have an especial fondness for children. That is seen in little girls, who,
though they know not so much as that they are maids, yet in their
childish games carry about dolls made of rags, rock them, cradle them,
and care for them; while boys build houses, ride on a hobby-horse, busy
themselves with making swords and erecting altars."</p>

<p>Like causes have occasioned the simultaneous disappearance of like
usages in countries widely separated. In the last generation children still
sang in our own towns the ancient summons to the evening sports&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Boys and girls, come out to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon it shines as bright as day;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and similarly in Provence, the girls who conducted their ring-dances in
the public squares, at the stroke of ten sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ten hours said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maids to bed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the usage has departed in the quiet cities of Southern France, as in
the busy marts of America.</p>

<p>It is much, however, to have the pleasant memory of the ancient rules
which youth established to direct its own amusement, and to know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>our own land, new as by comparison it is, has its legitimate share in the
lore of childhood, in considering which we overleap the barriers of time,
and are placed in communion with the happy infancy of all ages. Let us
illustrate our point, and end these prefatory remarks, with a version of the
description of his own youth given by a poet of half a thousand years
since&mdash;no mean singer, though famous in another field of letters&mdash;the
chronicler Jean Froissart. He regards all the careless pleasures of infancy
as part of the unconscious education of the heart, and the thoughtless
joy of childhood as the basis of the happiness of maturity; a deep
and true conception, which we have nowhere seen so exquisitely developed,
and which he illuminates with a ray of that genuine genius which
remains always modern in its universal appropriateness, when, recounting
the sports of his own early life,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> many of which we recognize as still
familiar, he writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In that early childish day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was never tired to play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Games that children every one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love until twelve years are done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dam up a rivulet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a tile, or else to let<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A small saucer for a boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the purling gutter float;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over two bricks, at our will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To erect a water-mill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the end wash clean from dirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the streamlet, cap and shirt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We gave heart and eye together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see scud a sailing feather;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After I was put to school,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where ignorance is brought to rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There were girls as young as I</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>These I courted, by-and-by</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Little trinkets offering&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A pear, an apple, or glass ring</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their favor to obtain<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>And, sober earnest, so it is</i>.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And now and then it pleased us well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sift dust through a pierc&egrave;d shell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On our coats; or in time ripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cut out a wheaten pipe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those days for dice and chess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cared we busy children less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than mud pies and buns to make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heedfully in oven bake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of four bricks; and when came Lent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out was brought a complement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of river-shells, from secret hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Estimated above gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play away, as I thought meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the children of our street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they tossed a counter, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood and shouted, "Pitch it high!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the moon was shining bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We would play in summer night<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pince-merine</i>; and time so passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was more eager at the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than outset, and I thought it shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I was made to stop my game.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More to tell, we practised too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sport entitled <i>Queue loo loo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hook</i>, <i>Trottot Merlot</i>, <i>Pebbles</i>, <i>Ball</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we had assembled all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pears</i>, swiftly running; or were lief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play at <i>Engerrant the Thief</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now and then, for a race-course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a staff we made a horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called him <i>Gray</i>; or, in knight's guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We put our caps on helmet-wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a time, beside a maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mimic house of shells I made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon occasions we would choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The one who hit me I accuse</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Take Colin off</i>; and by-and-by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selected <i>King who does not lie</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ring</i>, <i>Prison-bars</i>; or were content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in-doors, with <i>Astonishment</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oats</i>, <i>Scorn</i>, or <i>Riddles</i>; nor forget<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Replies</i>, and <i>Grasses</i>, <i>Cligne-musette</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Retreat</i>, and <i>Mule</i>, and <i>Hunt the Hare</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Leaping</i> and <i>Palm-ball</i> had their share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Salt Cowshorn</i>, and <i>Charette Michaut</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oftentimes we chose to throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pebbles or pence against a stake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or small pits in the ground would make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And play at nuts, which he who lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pleasure bitterly was crossed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive a top was my delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From early morning until night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to blow, single or double,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through a tube a bright soap-bubble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a batch of three or four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rejoice our eyes the more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Games like these, and more beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late and early have I plied.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Followed a season of concern;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Latin I was made to learn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I missed, I was a dunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must be beaten for the nonce.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So manners changed, as hands severe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trained me to knowledge and to fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lessons done, when I was free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quiet I could never be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fought with my own mates, and thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was vanquished or victorious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a time it was my fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come home in a ragged state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meet reproof and chastisement;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, after all, 'twas pains misspent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, let a comrade come in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moment I had taken flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none could hinder; in that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasure unto me was power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though oft I found, as I find still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two inadequate to my will.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus I did the time employ&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may Heaven give me joy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all things tended to my pleasure,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Both my labor and my leisure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being alert and being still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hours had I at my own will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a wreath of violets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give maids for coronets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to me of more account<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the present of a count,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twenty marks, would be to-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a heart content and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a soul more free and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the verse may well recite.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, to fashion form and feature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Co-operated Love and Nature:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature made the body strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forces that to Love belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft and generous the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truly, if in every part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the body soul did live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should have been sensitive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a splendor upon earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I esteemed so seeing-worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clustered violets, or a bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peonies or roses red.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When approached the winter-time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out-of-doors was cold and rime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No loss had I what to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But read romances old and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did prefer, the rest above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those of which the theme was love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagining, as on I went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everything to my content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, since infantine delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft inclines the heart aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After his own living form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love my spirit did inform,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasure into profit turned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the fortitude I learned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the soul of high emprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath such merit in my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That its worth and preciousness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words of mine cannot express.<br /></span>

of collections, the resemblance of French games is probably nearly as close.
The case is not very different in Italy and Sweden, so far at least as concerns games of any
dramatic interest. Not till we come to Russia, do we find anything like an independent
usage. Taken altogether, our American games are as ancient and characteristic as any,
and throw much light on the European system of childish tradition.</p></div>

wished to honor. The Portuguese ladies who came to England with the Infanta in 1662
were not used to the custom; but, as Pepys says, in ten days they had "learnt to kiss
and look freely up and down." Kissing in games was, therefore, a matter of course, in all
ranks.</p></div>

<h3>No. 1.<br />

<i>Knights of Spain.</i></h3>

<p>This ancient and interesting, now nearly forgotten, game was in the
last generation a universal favorite in the United States, imported, no
doubt, by the early settlers of the country; and was equally familiar, in
numerous variations, through England and Scotland. It is not, however,
the exclusive property of English-speaking peoples, but current under a
score of forms throughout Europe&mdash;from Latin France, Italy, and Spain,
to Scandinavian Iceland, from the Finns of the Baltic coast to the Slavs of
Moravia. Its theme is courtship; but courtship considered according to
ancient ideas, as a mercantile negotiation. To "buy" a bride was the
old Norse expression for marriage, and in a similar sense is to be understood
the word "sold" in our rhyme. The frankly mercenary character
of the original transaction ceasing to be considered natural, it was turned
into a jest or satire in Sweden and Scotland. The present song assumed
all the grace and courtesy characteristic of the medi&aelig;val English ballad,
while a primitive form survived in Iceland; and a later outgrowth (our
No. 3) represented the whole affair as one of coquetry instead of bargaining,
substituting, for the head of the house or the mother, the bride
herself as the negotiator.</p>

<p>Our first version shows the form of the game as played in New York
in the early part of the century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On a sofa, or row of chairs, a mother, with her daughters on either
side, seated. Advance three suitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here come three lords out of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-courting of your daughter Jane."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My daughter Jane is yet too young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be ruled by your flattering tongue."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be she young, or be she old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis for the price she may be sold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So fare you well, my lady gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must turn another way."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn back, turn back, you Spanish knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scour your boots and spurs so bright."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My boots and spurs they cost you nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in this land they were not bought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor in this land will they be sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either for silver or for gold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">We must turn another way."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn back, turn back, you Spanish knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choose the fairest in your sight."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll not take one nor two nor three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pray, Miss [Lucy], walk with me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Spanish knight takes the girl named by the hand, and marches off
with her. Walking round the room, he returns, saying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here comes your daughter safe and sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her pocket a thousand pound,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On her finger a gay gold ring&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bring your daughter home again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Philadelphia the game had a peculiar ending, which, however, as we
shall see, preserved, though in a corrupt form, an ancient trait:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here comes your daughter safe and sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her pocket a thousand pound,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On her finger a gay gold ring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you take your daughter in?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The girl then runs away, the mother pursuing her. The Spanish knight
catches her, and brings her back, saying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here comes your daughter safe and sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her pocket <i>no</i> thousand pound,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On her finger <i>no</i> gay gold ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you take your daughter in?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The daughter then once more flies, and the Spanish knight has to catch
her.</p>

<p>The following is a New England version:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We are three brethren from Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to court your daughter Jane."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My daughter Jane is yet too young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be courted by your flattering tongue."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be she young, or be she old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is for gold she must be sold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then fare ye well, my lady gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must return another day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come back, come back, you Spanish knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your boots and spurs shine very bright."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My boots and spurs they count you nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in this town they were not bought."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come back, come back, you Spanish knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choose the fairest in your sight."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is too black, and that is too brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is the fairest in the town."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The only part of the country, so far as we know, in which the game
now survives is the neighborhood of Cincinnati, where it is still played
in a reduced but original form:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here comes a knight, a knight of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To court your daughter, lady Jane."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My lady Jane, she is too young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be controlled by flattering tongue."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be she young or be she old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauty's fair, she must be sold."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go back, go back, you Spanish man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choose the fairest in the land."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fairest one that I can see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is [Annie Hobart] to walk with me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The game now proceeds, "Here come two knights," then with three, four,
etc., till all the players are mated.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It will be proper to add some account of the comparative history of
this curious game. The English and Scotch versions, though generally
less well preserved, correspond to our American. But we find a more
primitive type in Iceland, where it is, or a few years ago was, an amusement
of winter evenings, played not by children, but by men and women,
in a form which indicates a high antiquity. The women ask the men, as
these advance, what they desire? The latter reply, "a maid," that is,
wife. The inquiry now is, what will they give? It is answered, <i>stone</i>.
This tender is scornfully refused, and the suitors retire in dudgeon, but
return to raise their offer, and at last proffer <i>gold</i>, which is accepted, and
the controversy ends in a dance.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Curiously enough, modern Scotland retains this song in nearly all the
rude simplicity of the Icelandic just referred to; though the negotiation,
instead of being taken as a matter of course, is turned into a satire, being
treated as the endeavor of a rich old bachelor to purchase a wife.</p>

<p>In the stewartry of Kirkendbright, says Chambers, <i>Janet jo</i> is a dramatic
entertainment among young rustics on winter evenings. A youth,
disguised as an old bachelor, enters the room bonnet in hand, bowing, and
declaring that "he has come to court Janet jo." The goodwife then demands,
"What'll ye gie for Janet jo?" He responds, a "peck of siller,"
but is told, "Gae awa', ye auld carle!" He retires, but soon returns, and
increases his offer, which is less scornfully rejected, until he proffers "three
pecks of gowd," which is accepted with the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come ben beside Janet jo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Janet jo, Janet jo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye're welcome to Janet jo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Janet, my jo."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The affair then ends in kissing. A comparison of details (such as the
diminishing scorn of the bargainer, and chagrin of the suitors at each rejection)
leaves no doubt that the Icelandic and Scotch forms of the game
were once (but many centuries since) identical.</p>

<p>The German versions are numerous, but corrupt, and less ancient and
characteristic. In one of the most spirited the mother assigns as a reason
for refusing the suitor, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her tresses are not braided,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wedding-gown not done.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Similarly, we find in an English fragment,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My mead's not made, my cake's not baked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you cannot have my daughter Jane.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a French form, not otherwise especially interesting, which
resembles our No. 3.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>More striking than the preceding, and abounding in singular correspondences
with the first three numbers of our own collection, is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Italian version, as played in Venice. In this game, one of the rows is
composed of a boy, who represents the head of the house, and five or six
girls who stand at his right and left. The other row is formed by the
<i>ambassador</i>, whose suite consists of boys and girls. These last advance
towards the first row, singing, "The ambassador is come," then, retreating,
sing a chorus, "Ol&agrave;, ol&agrave;, ol&agrave;." The conversation then proceeds in a
rhythmical way between the two rows as follows:</p>




<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="conversation">
<tr>
  <td>"What do you wish?"</td>
  <td>"A maid."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"Which maid?"</td>
  <td>"The fairest."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"Who is the fairest?"</td>
  <td>"Nineta bella."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"What husband will you give her?"</td>
  <td>"A chimney-sweep."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"That will not do."</td>
  <td>"The king of France."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"That will do well."</td>
  <td>"What dowry will you give her?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"A ducat."</td>
  <td>"It will not do."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"A zechin a day."</td>
  <td>"That will do well."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"Come and take her."</td>
  <td>"Here I come and take her."</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The "ambassador" advances and takes the girl by the hand; then, as
if changing his mind, rejects her, saying as he returns&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="rejects ">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>"And now I don't want her!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"Why do you not want her?"</td>
  <td>"She is too little (or ugly)."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"Is that the trouble?"</td>
  <td>"Yes, that is the trouble."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>"Come, let us make peace."</td>
  <td>"Peace is made."</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The ambassador then takes by the hand the girl, who is presented
to him by the head of the house; the two files unite to form a circle,
and the bride receives the general congratulations of the company, who
clap their hands, courtesy, and sing,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> as in the pretty English equivalent&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the bells will ring, and the birds will sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we'll all clap hands together.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Spain, the game is known as the "Embassy of the Moorish King."
The "King of the Moors" is seated on the ground, with crossed legs, his
attendants about him. The "ambassador" makes three steps forward, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>demands one of his daughters. The king replies, "If I have them, I have
them not to give away; of the bread which I eat, they shall eat as well."</p>

<p>The ambassador withdraws angry: "In discontent I go from the
king's palace." But the king, repenting, calls after him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn thee, knight, come, turn thee hither,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most fair I'll give to thee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most lovely and the sweetest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweetest rose upon the tree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ambassador crosses hands with one of his train to make a seat, on
which the bride is placed in triumph, singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus I take her for her marriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spouse and wedded wife to be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king addresses them on departure&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Listen, knight, I do entreat thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use to her all courtesy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the ambassadors reply&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She, on throne of splendor seated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be shining to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall lodge within a palace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall dress in pearls and gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that the three knights originally represent not
suitors, but envoys. If we remember that marriage, in some simple countries,
is still conducted through intermediaries, whose duty it is to argue,
chaffer, and dispute, before coming to the decision all along intended, we
shall see reason to believe that from a form representing more or less
literally the usages of primitive society have sprung in the course of
time a multitude of confused representations, colored by later tastes and
feelings.</p>

<p>The spirit and substance of the courteous and chivalric English rhyme
cannot be later than the fourteenth century; the identity and primitive
rudeness of the song in Iceland, Scotland (and, we shall presently add,
Virginia), supposes an earlier date; while even then we have to bridge
the gap between these forms and the Italian. We may, therefore, be tolerably
sure that the first diffusion of the game in Europe dates far back
into the Middle Age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>


<h3>No. 2.<br />

<i>Three Kings.</i></h3>

<p>This antique rhyme, which comes to us from West Virginia, is a rude
and remarkable variety of the preceding game, but quite unlike any
English version hitherto printed.</p>

<p>We find a singular and apparently connected equivalent in the F&auml;r&ouml;e
isles. In the form of the dialogue there in use, as in the present game,
the suitor is presented in successively higher characters, as a thrall, smith,
and so on, until he is finally accepted as a prince. The Italian song has
shown us a similar usage. Thus the surf-beaten rocks of the North Atlantic,
with their scanty population of fishermen and shepherds, whose
tongue is a dialect of the ancient Norse speech, are linked by the golden
chain (or network) of tradition with the fertile vales of the Alleghenies,
and the historic lagoons of Venice.</p>

<p>The corrupt ending, too, compared with the Philadelphia version
already cited, and with the Venetian game, is seen to rest on an ancient
basis. The children, having forgotten the happy close, and not understanding
the haggling of the suitors, took the "three kings" for bandits.</p>

<h3>No. 3.<br />

<i>Here Comes a Duke.</i></h3>

<p>This rhyme is only a later development of the same game. The suitor
is now made to address himself directly to his mistress, and the mercenary
character of the previous transaction is replaced by coquetry. Our New
England song loses nothing by comparison with the pretty Scotch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>A company of little girls sit in a row. A little girl from the middle
of the room goes dancing up to the first one in the row, singing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here comes a duke a-roving,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Roving, roving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here comes a duke a-roving,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pretty fair maid, will you come out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you come out, will you come out,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To join us in our dancing?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Little girl answers,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Suitor steps backward, singing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Naughty girl,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> she won't come out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She won't come out, she won't come out,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To join us in our dancing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Suitor advances as before. The answer now is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These two now retire, singing together,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now we've got the flowers of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers of May, the flowers of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To join us in our dancing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They join hands and call out the next one in the row; thus the play
goes on until the last is selected, when they form a ring, dance, and sing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now we've got the flowers of May,<br /></span>

<p>We have thus a curious example of the way in which an apparently
meaningless game, which might be supposed the invention of the <i>gamins</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>of the street, is, in fact, a degenerate form of the ancient poetry, which
was brimful of grace, courtesy, and the joy of existence.</p>

<p>For a purpose presently to be mentioned, we must cite the corresponding
Scotch rhyme, given by Chambers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="right"><i>Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p>With this musical call to the dance, it was common, a generation since,
for girls in this town to begin the evening dances on the green, singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as they marched in couples. The "dust" of the rhyme is a corruption.
Comparing it with the Scotch song previously quoted, we do not doubt
that it represents the Scotch (in other words, old English) <i>adist</i>, the opposite
of <i>ayont</i>, meaning <i>this way</i>, come hither. We ought probably therefore
to read,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tread, tread the green grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Adist, adist, adist.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This song was no mere dance of rustics; the children at least kept up
the usage of the day when a pleasing popular poetry was the heritage of
all ranks. The spirit of the strain carries us back to that "carolling"
of ladies which was, in the time of Chaucer, no less than the gay green of
the meadow or the melody of the birds, an accompaniment of summer.</p>


<h3>No. 5.<br />

<i>I'll Give to You a Paper of Pins.</i></h3>

<p>This pretty and interesting, hitherto imprinted, children's song is more
or less familiar throughout the Middle States. We have heard it with
many variations from persons of all classes and ages. It may often be
listened to in the upper part of the city of New York, as it is sung (with
a mere apology for a melody) by three or four girls, walking with arms
entwined, or crooned by mere infants seated on the casks which, in the
poorer quarters, often encumber the sidewalk.</p>

<p>There are also English and Scotch versions, generally inferior as regards
poetical merit and antiquity of language. The English form, however,
seems to contain the primitive idea, where the wooer appears as a
prince, who by splendid presents overcomes the objections of a lady.
This mercenary character being repugnant to modern taste, the Scotch
rhyme represents the suitor as the Evil One in person; while in the
United States the hero is, in his turn, made to cast off the avaricious fair,
or else the lady to demand only love for love.</p>

<p>The numerous couplets of the American rhyme are completely in the
ballad style. A "paper of pins" is substituted for a "pennorth of pins."
The "easy-chair" is modern, but the verse itself ancient, combing golden
hair being a world-old occupation of beauties. The gown "trimmed with
golden thread," or "set off with a golden crown," refers to the attire of
olden times. The medi&aelig;val bride wore a crown on the head and flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
hair; a costume also mentioned in old ballads as the usual dress of a
demoiselle of rank arrayed for the dance.</p>

<span class="i0">"Will you have a paper of pins?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that's the way my love begins&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And I will marry you, you, you,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And I will marry you."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same idea is contained in a song originally Scotch, but which
comes to us (through an Irish medium) from Pennsylvania:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will you come to the Highland braes,<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Bonny lassie, Highland lassie</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you come to the Highland braes,<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>My bonny Highland lassie</i>?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reply is, "Na, na, it will not dee, bonnie laddie," etc.: when the wooer
gradually increases his offers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will give you a golden comb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you will be mine and never roam;"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>and finally inquires,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will you go to the kirk with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to be my wedded wife?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which is eagerly accepted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>And them's the words away to town</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will get my wedding-gown."<br /></span>

<h3>No. 7.<br />

<i>Green Grow the Rushes, O!</i></h3>

<p>In former times, the amusements of young people at their winter-evening
gatherings consisted almost entirely of "playing games." On
such occasions the following rhyme was used (in eastern Massachusetts)
about the beginning of the century, to select partners for the ring.
Chairs were placed in a circle, and the players of one sex seated, so as to
leave alternate vacant places, for which they chose occupants, singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Green grow the rushes, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green grow the rushes, O!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who will my true love be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come and sit by the side of me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those waiting to be selected sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pick and choose, but choose not me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose the fairest you can see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This dialogue was repeated for each player until all were taken in,
which, if the party was numerous, of necessity took a long time.</p>


<h3>No. 8.<br />

left.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the modern corruption of the street, which, however,
shows us the manner of playing:</p>

<p>A child stands in the ring, as the mother. The daughter reclines as if
asleep, her head resting on her hands, till the words, <i>rise up</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here <i>stands</i> a poor widow a-walking around,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Io! Io! Io!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So put on the night-cap to keep her head warm,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i4">To keep her head warm, Io!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rise up my daughter, and kiss whom you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And kiss whom you please, Io!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>New York.</i></p>

<p>The widow with daughters to marry is a European celebrity. The
titles <i>rich</i> and <i>poor</i>, moreover, in this and the last number, are not meaningless,
but show that two independent characters have been united in
one. In the original European game, which we have not encountered in
an English form, there is both a <i>rich</i> and a <i>poor</i> mother; the latter begs
away, one by one, the daughters of the former, until she has secured all.
The present round and the preceding are only reductions, or adaptations
to the dance, of this more ancient and dramatic game. Once more, the
game of the rich and poor mothers, though centuries old, and existing in
many European tongues, is itself but an outgrowth of a still more ancient
childish drama, which has given birth to innumerable sports, dances, and
songs, exhibiting very different external characteristics all over Europe,
but of which primitive and complete versions at present seem to exist
only in America.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>


<h3>No. 9.<br />

<i>Philander's March.</i></h3>

<p>This rhyme has been familiar throughout the New England States.
Some of our older readers will remember how the doors of all the apartments
of an old-fashioned mansion, with its great chimney in the centre,
would be thrown open at an evening party, and the children march
through the house, and up and down the staircase, singing the familiar
air&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, Philanders,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> let's be a-marching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every one choose from his heartstrings;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose your true love now or never,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be sure you choose no other.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, my dear&mdash;&mdash;, how I do love you!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing on earth do I prize above you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a kiss now let me greet you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will never, never leave you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Plymouth, Mass.</i> (about 1800).</p>

<p>Another version:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, Philander, let us be a-marching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the ranks there's no deserting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose your own, your own true lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See that you don't choose any other;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now farewell, dear love, farewell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're all a-marching, so farewell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Deerfield, Mass.</i></p>

<p>Why, of all the names of the Damon and Sylvia class, <i>Philander</i>,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
which, according to derivation, should mean fondness for the male sex,
came to be a proverbial expression for an amorous person, and contributed
to the English language a verb (to philander) we cannot say.
Children's intelligence made wild work of the word. A New England
variation was, "Come, <i>Lysanders</i>;" and in Pennsylvania, on the Maryland
border, the first line has been ingeniously distorted into "<i>Cumberland
city-town-boys</i>" marching! Cumberland being a town in the latter
state.</p>


<h3>No. 10.<br />

<i>Marriage.</i></h3>

<p>(1.) By this name was known in Massachusetts, at the beginning of the
century, an elaborate dance (for such, though practised in a Puritan community,
it really was) which has a very decided local flavor.</p>

<p>Partners having been chosen, the girl says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, my dearest partner, and join both heart and hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You want you a wife, and I want me a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So married we will be, if we can agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll march down together, so happy are we."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>The partners now separate, the lad saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now I must part, and leave you alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fare you well, my true love, till I return."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The maid replies&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I mourn, I mourn, for that is the cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm left all alone, and I'm sure I shall die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, after walking round, rejoins her partner, who welcomes her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, here comes my love, and how do you do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how have you been since I parted with you?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pair then address the row&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is a scene secure from all harm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please to give us joy by the raising of the arm."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other players, who stand each lad opposite his lass, raise arms, and the
couple walk down under the arch so formed, pausing at the foot&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now we are married, and never more to part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please to give a kiss from the bottom of the heart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the game proceeds with the next couple.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Scituate, Mass.</i> (about 1800).</p>

<p>(2.) No better as respects poetry, but with more evidence of old English
origin, is the following game, in which couples circle in a ring about
two chairs, from time to time changing partners. We have not been
clearly informed of the way of playing, but presume that at the time
of the change the youth or girl in the ring must select a mate.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On the green carpet here we stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take your true love in your hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the one whom you profess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the one whom you love best."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A change of partners.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Very well done, said Johnny Brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this the way to London town?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand ye here, stand ye there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till your true love doth appear."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>A mate is finally chosen, and the ring sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, what a beautiful choice you've made!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't you wish you'd longer stayed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">[Give her a kiss, and send her away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell her she can no longer stay."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Salem, Mass.</i></p>

<p>The "green carpet" is, of course, the grass, on which the village dance
proceeds in the summer-time,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and the remains of an ancient "carol"
appear in the corrupt rhyme.</p>

<p>(3.) To the game of <i>Marriage</i>, as played in France and Italy, the following
closely corresponds:</p>

<p>A boy and girl having been chosen by singing our No. 17, and standing
in the centre of the ring, the game proceeds, with imitative motion
and gesture&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Row the boat! Row the boat!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Let the boat stand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; is a handsome young man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; is as handsome as he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shall be married, if they can agree."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such short rhymes are not used independently, but joined to some fragment
of a ballad, which they serve to turn into a game, as may be seen in
our No. 12.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>(4.) We take this opportunity to give one or two other familiar examples
of kissing rounds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had I as many eyes as the stars in the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And were I as old as Adam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd fall on my knees, and kiss whom I please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your humble servant, madam.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Boston, half a century since, this ran&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As many <i>wives as the stars in the skies</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each <i>as old as Adam</i>, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Georgia, at the present day&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many, many stars are in the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>each as old as Adam</i>, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(5.) The following is yet more inane, yet it furnishes a curious example
of correspondence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; languishes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For whom?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is not much more crude than the French equivalent.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>(6.) We may add that the familiar American game, known as "Pillow,"
or "Pillows and Keys" (why <i>keys</i>?), in which a player kneels on a <i>pillow</i>
and solicits a kiss, is no doubt a descendant of the "Cushion Dance,"
alluded to by old dramatists.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Round of Girls in Venice.</i></p>


<h3>No. 11.<br />

<i>Miss Jennia Jones.</i></h3>

<p>This childish drama has been familiar in the Middle States since the
memory of the oldest inhabitant. The Scotch equivalent shows that the
heroine's name was originally <i>Jenny jo</i>. "Jo" is an old English word
for sweetheart, probably a corruption of <i>joy</i>, French <i>joie</i>, used as a term
of endearment. <i>Jenny my joy</i> has thus been modernized into Miss Jennia
(commonly understood to be a contraction for Virginia) Jones!</p>

<p>The story is originally a love-tale. The young lady, like Rosetina in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the Venetian song (a part of which we have translated above) dies of
blighted affection and the prohibition of cruel parents. The suitor, in
America, is represented by feminine friends. Yet the drama has lived;
a proof that in singing and playing love-tales the children rather imitated
their elders than followed a necessity of their own nature.</p>

<p>From various versions we select the following:</p>

<p>A mother, seated. Miss Jennia Jones stands behind her chair, or reclines
on her lap as if lying sick. A dancer advances from the ring.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I've come to see Miss Jennia Jones,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Miss Jennia Jones, Miss Jennia Jones&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've come to see Miss Jennia Jones,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And how is she to-day?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She's up-stairs washing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Washing, washing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She's up-stairs washing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You cannot see her to-day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The questions are repeated to the same air for every day of the week,
and the reply is that Miss Jennia Jones is ironing, baking, or scrubbing.
She is then represented as sick, as worse, and finally as dead, which announcement
is received with signs of deep grief. The dancers of the
ring then discuss the costume in which she shall be buried:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What shall we dress her in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dress her in, dress her in;<br /></span>

<p>After the ceremonies of burial have been completed, the ghost of Miss

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I dreamt I saw a ghost last night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I dreamt I saw a ghost last night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under the apple-tree!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ring breaks up, and flies with shrieks, and the one caught is to represent
Miss Jennia Jones.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of our game is the symbolism of color. "Each
of these colors," says an informant, "which denoted a profession, also
typified a feeling. Thus, blue, which is said to be for <i>sailors</i>, suggested
<i>constancy</i>."</p>

<p>In one version of the game, which comes to us from an Irish source,
<i>green</i> is for <i>grief, red</i> for <i>joy, black</i> for <i>mourning</i>, and <i>white</i> for <i>death</i>.
In another such version, <i>white</i> is for <i>angels</i>, and is the chosen color; a
reading we would willingly adopt, as probably more ancient, and as expressing
the original seriousness of the whole, and the feeling which the
color of white symbolized. In more common Irish phrase, <i>green</i> is for
<i>Irish</i>, <i>yellow</i> for <i>Orangemen</i>. In Cincinnati, <i>purple</i> is for <i>kings</i> and
<i>queens</i>, <i>gray</i> for <i>Quakers</i>. In a Connecticut variation, <i>yellow</i> is for <i>glad
folks</i>.</p>

<p>An English saying corresponds closely to the significance of colors in
our game:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blue is true, yellow is jealous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green is forsaken, red is brazen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White is love, and black is death.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A variation from West Virginia makes the question apply to the dress
of the mourners, not of the deceased: "What shall we dress in?" "In
our red, in our blue," etc., are rejected, and the decision is, "In our white."</p>

<p>Such imitations of burial ceremonies are not merely imaginative. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was once the custom for the girls of a village to take an active part in the
interment of one of their number. In a Flemish town, a generation since,
when a young girl died, her body was carried to the church, thence to the
cemetery, by her former companions. "The religious ceremony over, and
the coffin deposited in the earth, all the young girls, holding in one hand
the mortuary cloth, returned to the church, chanting the <i>maiden's dance</i>
with a spirit and rhythm scarcely conceivable by one who has not heard it.
The pall which they carried to the church was of sky-blue silk, having in
the middle a great cross of white silk, on which were set three crowns of
silver."</p>

<p>The following is a rendering of the "Maiden's Dance:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In heaven is a dance;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Alleluia!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There dance all the maids;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Benedicamus Domino&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Alleluia!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is for Amelia;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Alleluia!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We dance like the maids;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Benedicamus Domino&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Alleluia!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such touching customs show the profound original earnestness underlying
the modern child's play, as well as the primitive religious significance
of the dance. In England, too, it was the practice for the bearers
of a virgin to be maids, as a ballad recites:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A garland fresh and faire<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of lilies there was made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In signe of her virginity,<br /></span>

<p>The song before us furnishes a good example of the persistency of
childish tradition. Not only is it still current in New England and the
Middle States, with words closely corresponding to those given in our
version of almost a century since, but these words are also nearly identical
with the language of the round as we are told it is sung at the present
day in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Of a type similar to the foregoing is an ancient and curious, but
unpublished, nursery song,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the first lines of which, at least, will be familiar
to some of our readers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sing, sparrow, sing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall I sing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the boys in our town have gone courting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but little Charley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stays at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he says he'll have Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else he'll have none.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Row, boat, row!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall I row?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to little Mary's door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out jumps little Charley in his boots and spurs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And goes to the door, and pulls at the string&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where's little Mary? Is she within?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Miss Mary's up-stairs, a-making a cap."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then down comes Miss Mary, as white as the milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All dressed in pink posies and sweet pretty silk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And goes to the cupboard, and takes up the can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drinks to little Charley, a pretty little man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He takes her in his lap, and pares her nails,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives her a posy of peacock's tails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rings and jewels fit for her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tells little Mary he'll come again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mention in this rhyme of the cupboard and the can carries us
to a time not so remote indeed in years, but far removed in customs. At
the beginning of the century, in the old colonial towns, tumblers were
unknown; the silver can stood on the table, and was passed from hand
to hand at the meal, the elders drinking first. This usage was accompanied
with much ceremony. An informant (born in Salem, Mass.),
whose memory goes back almost to the beginning of the century, recollects
how, when it came to be his turn to drink, he was obliged to rise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>and wipe his lips (the use of the same vessel by a whole family made this
habit proper), and repeat the words, while parents and friends laid down
knives and forks and looked on, "Duty to Sir and Ma'am, respects to
aunt, love to brother and sister, and health to myself." Sometimes, he
said, sensitive children would rather "go dry" than endure this ordeal.</p>

<i>Green Gravel.</i></h3>

<p>A girl sits in the ring, and turns her head gravely as a messenger
advances, while the rest sing to a pleasing air&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i005.png" width="700" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Green gravel, green gravel, the grass is so green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the free <i>masons</i> (maidens) are <i>ashamed</i> (arrayed?) to "be seen;"<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>There are only two lines left of the ballad, or rather reminiscence
of one.</p>

<p>A French round begins similarly: "Ah, the bringer of letters!
What news is this? Ah, it is news that you must change your love.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Must I change my love, I prefer to die; he is not here, nor in France; he
is in England, where he serves the gracious king." To this fragment belong
the ancient verses which we have set as the motto of Chapter II. of
our Introduction. All the other ladies of Paris are at the dance; the
king's daughter alone "regarde &agrave; cot&eacute;," "turns her head," looking at a
messenger who is approaching; he brings news of her love's unfaithfulness;
a rival skilled in magic arts has enchanted him, in the far country
where he is warring. There is no more left of the ancient ballad, which,
we presume, went on to describe her departure in man's costume, and
rescue of her lover. We cannot prove the identity of our fragment, but
we see how the child's game may have arisen.</p>

<h3>No. 16.<br />

<i>Uncle John.</i></h3>

<p>A ring of dancers who circle and sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Uncle John is very sick, what shall we send him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A piece of pie, a piece of cake, a piece of apple-dumpling.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Take her by the lily-white hand, and lead her over the water.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the words "governor's daughter" all the dancers fall down, and the
last down stands apart, selects her confidential friend, and imparts with
great mystery the <i>initials</i> of some boy in whom she takes an interest.
She then returns, and takes her place in the ring with face reversed, while
the friend announces the initials, and the dancers sing, using the letters
given&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A. B., so they say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here's a kiss, and there's a kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s daughter.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the person representing "Uncle John" be a boy, his full name comes
first in this rhyme, and the initials of the girl are used.</p>

<p>The choice of the confidante is said to require as much deliberation as
the selection of an ambassador of state.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Hartford, Conn.</i></p>

<p>This is one of the most familiar of all children's rounds in our country.
It is, we see, a love-history; and, thrice vulgarized as it is, bears
traces of ancient origin, and may perhaps be the last echo of the medi&aelig;val
song in which an imprisoned knight is saved from approaching death
by the daughter of the king, or soldan, who keeps him in confinement.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<i>King Arthur was King William's Son.</i></h3>

<p>A row of hats of various sizes, and belonging to both sexes, are placed
on the floor. The leader picks up the first hat, and puts it on his own
head, marching and singing the verse. He then takes up the next hat, and
places it on the head of any one he pleases; the person chosen stands behind
him, and they once more march, singing. The process is continued,
until all the company are arranged in line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The round is also familiar in Ireland. We learn from an informant
that in her town it was formerly played in a peculiar manner. Over
the head of a girl, who stood in the centre of a ring, was held a shawl,
sustained by four others grasping the corners. The game then proceeded
as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">King William was King George's son&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>From the Bay of Biscay, O!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his breast he wore a star&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Find your way to English schools.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then followed the game-rhyme, repeated with each stanza, "Go choose
you East," etc. King William is then supposed to enter&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first girl that I loved so dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can it be she's gone from me?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If she's not here when the night comes on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will none of you tell me where she is gone?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He recognizes the disguised girl&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's heart beneath the willow-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no one here but my love and me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"He had gone to the war, and promised to marry her when he came
back. She wrapped a shawl about her head, to see if he would recognize
her." This was all the reciter could recollect; the lines of the ballad
were sung by an old woman, the ring answering with the game-rhyme.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Waterford, Ireland.</i></p>

<p>The round now in use in the town whence this comes, but where the
ballad is not at present known, begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">King William was King George's son&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>From the Bay of Biscay, O!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his breast he wore a star&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Point your way across the sea.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the year 1287, Folke Algotson, a high-born Swedish youth, carried
off to Norway (at that time the refuge of such boldness) Ingrid, a daughter
of the "law-man" or judge of East Gothland, who was betrothed to a
Danish noble. Popular ballads attached themselves to the occurrence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
which are still preserved. The substance of that version of the story with
which we are concerned is as follows: A youth loves a maid, who returns
his affection, but in his absence her friends have "given" her to another.
He rides to the wedding ceremony with a troop of followers. The bride,
seeing him approach, and wishing to test his affection, calls on her maidens
to "take off her gold crown, and coif her in linen white." But the
hero at once recognizes his love, mounts with her on horseback, and flees
to Norway.</p>

<p>We cannot believe the resemblance to be accidental, and look upon
our rhymes as a branch from the same ancient&mdash;but not historical&mdash;root.</p>


<h3>No. 18.<br />

<i>Little Harry Hughes and the Duke's Daughter.</i></h3>

<p>The writer was not a little surprised to hear from a group of colored
children, in the streets of New York city (though in a more incoherent
form) the following ballad. He traced the song to a little girl living in
one of the cabins near Central Park, from whom he obtained this version.
The hut, rude as the habitation of a recent squatter on the plains, was
perched on a rock still projecting above the excavations which had been
made on either side, preparatory to the erection of the conventional
"brown-stone fronts" of a New York street. Rocks flung by carelessly
managed explosions flew over the roof, and clouds of dust were blown by
every wind into the unswept hovel. In this unlikely spot lingered the
relics of old English folk-song, amid all the stir of the busiest of cities.
The mother of the family had herself been born in New York, of Irish
parentage, but had learned from her own mother, and handed down to
her children, such legends of the past as the ballad we cite. A pretty
melody gave popularity to the verse, and so the thirteenth-century tradition,
extinct perhaps in its native soil, had taken a new lease of existence
as a song of negro children in New York.</p>

<p>Under the thin disguise of the heading will be recognized the ballad
of "Hugh of Lincoln and the Jew's Daughter," the occasion of which is
referred by Matthew Paris to the year 1255. Chaucer, in exquisite verse,
has made his Prioress recount the same story: how the child,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This gemme of chastit&egrave;, this emeraude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eek of martirdom the ruby bright,<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>has his throat cut by "false Jewes," and, cast into a pit, still sings his chant
in honor of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This welle of mercy, Christes moder sweet;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and, when discovered, cannot be buried in peace till the magic grain is
removed which "that blissful maiden fre" has laid under his tongue.</p>

<p>The conclusion is, in our version, only implied. In that given by
Jamieson the murdered child, speaking from the well, bids his mother
prepare the winding-sheet, for he will meet her in the morn "at the back
of merry Lincoln;" and the funeral service is performed by angels.</p>

<h3>No. 19.<br />

<i>Barbara Allen.</i></h3>

<p>In the first quarter of the century, this celebrated ballad was still used
in New England as a children's game or dance at evening parties. We
have here, perhaps, the latest English survival, in cultivated society, of a
practice which had once been universal. It is noteworthy that while, in
the town of which we speak,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> the establishment, at the period alluded to,
of a children's dancing-school was bitterly opposed, and the children of
"church members" were hardly permitted to attend, no such prohibition
applied to amusements like this, which were shared in irrespective of
sectarian prejudice, by boys as well as by girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Our informant describes the performers as standing in couples, consisting
each of a boy and a girl, facing each other. An elderly lady, who
was in particular request at children's parties on account of her extensive
stock of lore of the sort, sang the ballad, to which the dancers kept time
with a slow metrical movement, balancing without any considerable
change of place. At the final words, "Barbara Allen," which end every
stanza, a courtesy took the place of the usual refrain. The whole performance
is described as exceedingly pretty, stately, and decorous. It
cannot be doubted that the version of the ballad sung was traditional,
but we have not been able to secure it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The song exhibits numerous marks of antiquity. "Picks up a pin" was originally,
no doubt, "pulls at the pin." The word "garret" here appears to correspond to the
Scandinavian "high-loft," the upper part and living-room of an ancient house. The third
verse is a very ancient ballad commonplace&mdash;

<p class="right">"Ballad of Kinge Adler," in the Percy MS.</p>

<p>
Instead of "Water, water, wild-flowers," as printed on the next page, we find in Philadelphia,
"<i>Lily, lily, white-flower</i>," which may have been the original, and reminds us of the
refrains of certain ballads. In Yorkshire, England, "<i>Willy, willy, wall-flower</i>."
</p>
<p>
A specimen of the quintessence of absurdity is the following street-song:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swallow, swallow, weeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About a willow tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the boys in Fiftieth Street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are dying down below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excepting &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His love he can't deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he loves &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she loves him beside, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Notwithstanding the vulgarity of these stanzas, and of others which are employed for
the same purpose, the practice which they illustrate&mdash;namely, the adaptation of a ballad to
the dance by uniting with it a game-rhyme&mdash;is no doubt ancient. We have other examples
in the numbers which follow.</p></div>

<h2>III.<br />

<i>PLAYING AT WORK.</i></h2>


<div class="hangingindent">

<p>"The king (George III.) danced all night, and finished with the <i>Hemp-dressers</i>,
that lasted two hours."&mdash;<i>Memoir of Mrs. Delany.</i></p></div>


<h3>No. 20.<br />

<i>Virginia Reel.</i></h3>

<p>This dance, which we will not here attempt to describe, is no doubt
well known to our readers; but we doubt if any of them has reflected on
its significance. It is, in fact, an imitation of <i>weaving</i>. The first movements
represent the shooting of the shuttle from side to side, and the
passage of the woof over and under the threads of the warp; the last
movements indicate the tightening of the threads, and bringing together
of the cloth.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>There is a very similar Swedish dance, called "Weaving Woollen," in
which the words sung are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weave the woollen and bind it together,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Let the shuttle go round!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The originally imitative character of the dance is thus well illustrated.
The "Hemp-dressers' Dance," in which George III. figured, seems to
have resembled this, according to the description quoted in the memoir
referred to in the heading of this chapter.</p>


<h3>No. 21.<br />

<i>Oats, Pease, Beans, and Barley Grows.</i></h3>

<p>This round, although very familiar to all American children, seems,
strangely enough, to be unknown in Great Britain; yet it is still a favorite
in France, Provence, Spain, Italy, Sicily, Germany, and Sweden; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>played by Froissart (born 1337), and Rabelais (born 1483); while the general
resemblance of the song in European countries proves that in the five
centuries through which we thus trace it, even the words have undergone
little change. Like the first game of our collection, it is properly
a dance rather of young people than of children; and a comparative
examination of versions inclines us to the belief that it is of Romance
descent. The lines of the French refrain,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and the general form of the
dance, suggest that the song may probably have had (perhaps in remote
classic time) a religious and symbolic meaning, and formed part of rustic
festivities designed to promote the fertility of the fields; an object which
undoubtedly formed the original purpose of the May festival. So much
for conjecture; but, in any case, it is pleasant to think of the many generations
of children, in so many widely separated lands, who have rejoiced
in the pretty game.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>And make your husband chop the wood</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What we have said of the permanency of the words applies only to the
action, the essential part, of the game. The <i>amatory chorus</i>, by which
the song is made to serve the purpose of love-making, is very variable.
Thus we have the quaint conclusion of the last line at greater length:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now you're married in Hymen's band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must obey your wife's command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must obey your constant good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep your wife in hickory wood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Split the wood and carry it in, [<i>twice</i>]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she'll let you kiss her again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Splitting the wood" was a very troublesome part of the New England
farmer's m&eacute;nage.</p>

<p>More commonplace are the choruses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You must be good, you must be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do as you see others do.<br /></span>

<p>Or again&mdash;</p>

"cats and dogs."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of the century the essential stanza went thus in New
Hampshire:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus my father sows his seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands erect and takes his ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stamps his foot, and claps his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirls about, and thus he stands.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Swedish quatrain is nearly the same:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had a father, he sowed this way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he had done, he stood this way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stamped with his foot, he clapped with his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned about, he was so glad.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The French rhyme, by its exact correspondence, proves the great antiquity
of the formula.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The German game, as is often the case with German children's games
and ballads in general, is more modernized than in the other tongues, and
has become a coarse jest. It is represented how the farmer sows his oats,
cuts it, binds it, carries it home, stores it, threshes it, takes it to market,
sells it, spends the money in carousal, comes home drunk, and quarrels
with his wife, because she has cooked him no supper! Verily, a satire
from the lips of children!</p>

<p>Fauriel, in his history of Proven&ccedil;al literature, alludes to this song,
which it seems he had seen danced in Provence, and considers to be derived
from, and to represent, choral dances of Greek rustics. "The words
of the song," he says, speaking of these ancient dances, "described an
action, a succession of different situations, which the dancers reproduced
by their gestures. The song was divided into many stanzas, and terminated
by a refrain alike for all. The dancers acted or gesticulated only to
imitate the action or situation described in each stanza; at the refrain
they took each other by the hand and danced a round, with a movement
more or less lively. There are everywhere popular dances derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>these, which more or less resemble them.... I remember to have seen in
Provence some of these dances, of which the theme seems to be very ancient&mdash;one,
among the rest, imitating successively the habitual actions of a
poor laborer, working in his field, sowing his wheat or oats, mowing, and
so on to the end. Each of the numerous couplets of the song was sung
with a slow and dragging motion, as if to imitate the fatigue and the
sullen air of the poor laborer; and the refrain was of a very lively
movement, the dancers then giving way to all their gayety."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The French, Italian, and Spanish versions of this game also represent
a series of actions, sowing, reaping, etc., of which our own rhyme has retained
only one stanza. There is a whole class of similar rounds, which
describe the labors of the farmer, vine-dresser, etc. That such a song,
danced in sowing-time, and representing the progress and abundance of
the crop, should be supposed to bring a blessing on the labors of the year,
is quite in conformity with what we know of popular belief, ancient and
modern. When a French savant asked the peasants of La Ch&acirc;tre why
they performed the dance of "Threading the Needle" (see No. 29), the
answer was, "To make the hemp grow." It is not in the least unlikely
that the original of the present chant was sung, with a like object, by
Italian rustics in the days of Virgil.</p>

<p>Each girl then lets go of her partner's arm, and takes the arm of the one in
advance, and the solitary player endeavors meanwhile to slip into the line.</p>

<p>The following is a variation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It snows and it blows, and it's cold frosty weather,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>It is played by children in New York city as a kissing-game in the
ring, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<span class="i0">Go round the ring, and see if you can find her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you cannot find her, go and choose another one.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We meet our game once more in North Germany. But its prettiest
form is among the Fins of the Baltic coast, where it is extremely pleasing
and pastoral:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Reap we the oat harvest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who will come and bind it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, perhaps his darling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treasure of his bosom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where have I last seen her?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yesterday at evening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yesterday at morning!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When will she come hither,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her little household,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her gentle escort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">People of her village?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has not a partner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him pay a forfeit!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that, even where this simple people have borrowed
the dramatic idea of an amusement from their more civilized
neighbors, they have developed it with a sweetness and grace which put
the latter to shame.</p>

<p>And so on, the performers lamenting the duty which lies upon them of
scrubbing their floors, baking their bread, etc.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Louisiana.</i></p>

<p>This pretty dance, with its idiomatic English, which comes to us from
the extreme South, is obviously not modern. The chorus refers, not to the
place of the labor, but to the locality of the dance: it may have been originally
<i>in my lady's garden</i>. Our informant remembers the game as danced
by negro children, their scanty garments flying as the ring spun about the
trunk of some large tree; but (though the naive appeal to pity may seem
characteristic of Southern indolence) this is evidently no negro song.</p>

<p class="right"><i>New York streets.</i></p>

<p>As with most street-games, further inquiry has shown us that the song
is old in America. Not merely the substance (which is identical with
our last two numbers), but also the expression, is paralleled in France
and Italy, and even on the extreme limits of European Russia.</p>

indicates a high antiquity. This bridge, which figures in French nursery-lore
as London Bridge does in our own, was built in 1177. Bridges, in
the Middle Age, were the most important structures in the land, places
of festivity and solemnity, dances, trials, and executions.</p>

<i>Here We Come Gathering Nuts of May.</i></h3>

<p>Two opposite rows of girls. One side advances and sings, the other
side replying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here we come gathering nuts of May, [<i>thrice</i>]<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The game is continued until all players are brought to one side.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Charlestown, W. Va.</i></p>

<p>This game is probably a recent importation from England, where it is
very well known. It seems likely that the imitative dance really belongs
to the season of nut-gathering,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and that the phrase, "Nuts of <i>May</i>," and
the refrain, have crept in from its later use as a May-game.</p>

<i>Here I Brew, and Here I Bake.</i></h3>

<p>A ring of children clasp hands by clenching fingers; a single child
within the circle repeats the rhyme, making appropriate gestures over
successive pairs of hands; at the last words he (or she) throws himself
(or herself) against what is thought the most penetrable point.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here I brew and here I bake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here I make my wedding-cake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here I must break through.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following is a different version:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here I bake and here I brew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here I lay my wedding-shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here I must and shall break through.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the first attempt is not successful, the player within the ring runs to
attack some other point. After the ring is broken, the child on his right
continues the game. In New York, a violent form of the same sport
goes by the name of "Bull in the Ring."</p>

<p>The pair then kissed, and the game proceeded as in "London Bridge,"
ending with a tug-of-war.</p>

<p>The name, "Threading the Needle," is still applied, in a district of
central France, to a dance in which many hundred persons take part, in
which from time to time the pair who form the head of the row raise
their arms to allow the line to pass through, coiling and winding like a
great serpent.</p>

soldier the most varied wardrobe possible; while the maiden put the

<p>The subject of this and the preceding number has furnished endless
mirth to popular poetry. The present song is ancient; for it is identical
with a German, Flemish, and French round of the fifteenth or sixteenth
century, in which a <i>nun</i> (or monk) is tempted to <i>dance</i> by similar offers.
The spirit of the latter piece seems to be rather light-hearted ridicule than
puritanic satire, and the allusion does not show that the piece is subsequent
to the Reformation.</p>

<p>A kiss was the prescription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>We insert this silly little round, chiefly because, according to Madame
Celnart, a French equivalent was in favor, not with infants, but ladies and
gentlemen in polite society, only half a century since. Our authority says:</p>

<p>"The master or the mistress of this round is called <i>doctor</i>. This
doctor takes the arm of the person seated on his right, regards him or
her with an eye of compassion, feels his pulse, and then gives his order,
which everybody repeats, singing, 'Give me your arm that I may cure you,
for you seem to me to look ill.'<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Then, designating by a glance some person
of the other sex, he says, 'Embrace monsieur (or madame) to cure you;
it is an excellent remedy.' All the persons in the ring are submitted
to this treatment, which the physician knows how to render piquant by
the choice of the panacea which he recommends to his patient; when
everybody is cured, the doctor passes over his science and dignity to the
last person who has tested the efficacy of his prescription, and in his turn
falls sick, to make trial of the pleasing remedy."</p>

<p>The general theme of our vulgarized round is more agreeably expressed
in the quaint and ancient Canadian song which we have cited as
the motto of the present chapter.</p>

<p>An odd number of players, of whom the one not paired stands in the

<p>The miller, whose pay used to be taken in a proportion of corn ground,
was a common object of popular satire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>In Germany the mill-wheel, as it slowly revolves, is said to exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>"Round and Round, the Mill Goes Round," is mentioned as an English
dance at the end of the seventeenth century. A song of "The Happy
Miller" is printed in "Pills to Purge Melancholy" (1707), of which the
first verse is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How happy is the mortal that lives by his mill!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How merrily his mill goes, clack, clack, clack!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This song was doubtless founded on the popular game; but the modern
children's sport has preserved the idea, if not the elegance, of the old
dance better than the printed words of a hundred and seventy years
since. A variation of the same game is still familiar in Canada and

<p>The marguerite (<i>Doronicum bellidiastrum</i>) is asked in the same country:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heaven, hell, purgatory, paradise?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in Styria is called "Love's Measure," because it determines the return
of affection according to the well-known formula, "He loves me, he
loves me not," for which a French equivalent is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Je t'aime, un peu, beaucoup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tendrement, pas du tout.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in Switzerland again the questions for the marguerite exactly match
ours:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nobleman, beggar-man, farmer, soldier, student,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emperor, king, gentleman.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The verse is similar in Italy. It is curious to see the precise correspondence
of English and Continental forms.</p>

<p>Medi&aelig;val writers do not mention this use of flower-petals, but frequently
allude to the custom of drawing spires of grass, to secure the
longer (or shorter, as might be agreed). Thus lads might draw grasses,
for the purpose of deciding to which of the two a maiden might belong
as a partner. This was so usual a way of deciding a controversy that it
was even recognized in law, where the parties to a suit drew straws from
a thatch or sheaf. Children still resort to a like arbitrament, where one
holds the straws in the hand, and the other draws, the shorter straw winning.
To our surprise, we find that girls in Massachusetts still keep up
the medi&aelig;val usage; they draw stalks of grass in the field, and match
them, to decide who shall begin a game&mdash;be "it."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>We have seen that the formula "Loves me, loves me not," was used in
the Middle Age with grasses. In Italy the oracle is consulted by means
of the branch of a tree. A twig is taken having alternate leaves, and they
are detached one by one, the consulter always turning the head as the words
of the oracle are spoken. The formulas for this purpose closely resemble
our own: thus, "This year, another year, soon, never," which is exactly
identical with the English "This year, next year, some time, never;" or,
"He loves me, longs for me, desires me, wishes me well; wishes me ill,
does not care;" or, as in the Swiss form given, "Paradise, Purgatory,
<i>Caldron</i>" (that is, Inferno).</p>

<i>Use of Flowers in Games.</i></h3>

<p>Flowers are gathered and loved by children as they have always been,
and are used by them in all sorts of imaginative exercises of their own invention,
as, for instance, by girls in their imitative housekeeping; but
there is singularly little employment of them in any definite games. Formerly
it was otherwise; but the deep sympathy which blooming youth
once felt and expressed for the bloom of the year seems to have almost
disappeared.</p>

<p>In the Middle Age, as in classic antiquity, flowers were much in use for
dances. Great attention was paid to the significance of particular blooms.
"What flowers will you give me for a garland? What flowers are proper
for adornment?" are mentioned as names of sports. It was a practice for
the lover to approach his mistress with a flower or fruit which he offered
for her acceptance. If the girl accepted the gift, the youth led her out,
and the dance began. Another ancient practice was to throw to a girl
some bloom, at the same time pronouncing a couplet which rhymed with
the name of the flower. The ball, too, with which youths and maids
played, was sometimes made of flowers.</p>

<p>Almost the only relic of ancient usage of this sort, with us, is the employment
little girls make of dandelions, with which (in some parts of the
country) they make long garlands, cutting off the heads and stringing
them together.</p>

<p>This use of the dandelion is very old, from which it derives one of its
many German names, the <i>chain-flower</i> or <i>ring-flower</i>. On account of its
early bloom and golden hue it is especially the flower of spring, and seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to have had a religious and symbolic meaning. In Switzerland these garlands
are used in the dance, the children holding a long wreath of the
flowers so as to form a circle within the ring; and whoever breaks the
chain pays forfeit. The plant is said to be of healing virtue, gives happiness
to the lover, and, if plucked on particular days, will heal troubles
of the eye. It has these qualities on account of its brightness, which
causes it to be associated with the victorious power of light.</p>

<p>There are other ways of using this flower. A dandelion in seed is
held to the lips; if the seeds can all be blown off in three attempts, it is a
sign of successful love, of marriage within the year; or, with little girls,
that "my mother wants me."</p>

<p>Little girls also split the stalks of the flower, and, dipping them in cold
water, produce "curls," with which they adorn themselves. This usage,
too, is German.</p>

<p>We may speak of the trifling lore of one or two other flowers.
A buttercup is held against one child's chin by another, and a bright
reflection is supposed (prosaically enough) to indicate a fondness for
butter!</p>

<p>It was formerly said in New England that the heart's-ease (<i>Viola tricolor</i>)
represented a "step-mother sitting on two chairs." The petals being
turned up, the step-mother is seen to have two chairs, her children one
each, and her step-children only one between them.</p>

<p>That this flower represents an unkind step-mother is stated in a Low-German
rhyme of the fifteenth century; and step-mother is also an English
name for the heart's-ease. There is another reason for the title besides
that we have given. In Switzerland the flower is considered a type of
malice, because the older the flower is the more yellow and "jealous" it
becomes. Thus we have another striking example of the original similarity
of English and German usage.</p>

<p>Boys in the spring are fond of blowing on the fresh blades of grass,
with which they can make a loud but harsh trumpeting. This practice,
in Germany, is mentioned at the beginning of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>It is the custom still for boys to make whistles in the spring from the
loosened bark of the willow; but they do not guess that this was originally
a superstitious rite, the pipe cut from a tree which grows in the water
being supposed to have the power of causing rain. The Swiss children,
though unconsciously, still invoke the water-spirit as they separate the
bark from the wood:</p>

<i>Counting Apple-seeds.</i></h3>

<p>The following rhyme, used in New England at the beginning of the
present century, remains unchanged in a single word, except the omission
of the last three lines.</p>

<p>Apples formerly were an essential part of every entertainment in the
country; in the winter season, a dish of such always stood on the sideboard.
As the hours went by, a foaming dish of eggnog would be
brought in, always with a red-hot poker inserted, for the purpose of
keeping up the proper temperature. It was then that the apple, having
been properly named, with a fillip of the finger was divided, to decide the
fate of the person concerned according to its number of seeds.</p>

<i>Rose in the Garden.</i></h3>

<p>We insert here, on account of the allusions to nature which they contain,
several pieces which might also have found a place elsewhere in our
collection; the present, for instance, being eminently a "love-game."</p>

<p>A single player stands in the centre of the ring, which circles and
sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's a rose in the garden for you, fair man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a rose in the garden for you, fair maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a rose in the garden, pluck it if you can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be sure you don't choose a false-hearted one.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The youth or girl in the centre chooses a partner, and the ring sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's a bargain, it's a bargain, for you, fair man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a bargain, it's a bargain, for you, fair maid.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now follows a fragment of romance, which in our version is unhappily
corrupt:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You promised to marry me six months ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold you to your bargain, "<i>you old rogue you</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After a kiss, the first player takes his or her place in the ring, and the
partner selected is left to continue the game.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Deerfield, Mass.</i> (about 1810).</p>

<p>To the same game, perhaps, belongs the following fragment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here stands a red rose in the ring&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promised to marry a long time ago.<br /></span>

<p class="right"><i>Savannah, Georgia.</i></p>

<p>This song is not known in the North, and it is equally unrecorded in
English nursery-lore, but is very familiar in France (as well as Germany,
Denmark, etc.). We are inclined to look on it as an adaptation from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>the French, made by the children of <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>, like the curious game
which makes our next number.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>


<h3>No. 47.<br />

<i><em class="gesperrt">Green!</em></i></h3>

<p>In parts of Georgia and South Carolina, as soon as a group of girls are
fairly out of the house for a morning's play, one suddenly points the finger
at a companion with the exclamation, "Green!" The child so accosted
must then produce some fragment of verdure, the leaf of a tree, a blade
of grass, etc., from the apparel, or else pay forfeit to the first after the
manner of "philop$oelig;na." It is rarely, therefore, that a child will go
abroad without a bit of "green," the practice almost amounting to a
superstition. The object of each is to make the rest believe that the
required piece of verdure has been forgotten, and yet to keep it at hand.
Sometimes it is drawn from the shoe, or carried in the brooch, or in the
garter. Nurses find in the pockets, or in the lining of garments, all manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>of fragments which have served this purpose. This curious practice
is not known elsewhere in America; but it is mentioned by Rabelais, under
the name by which it is still played in parts of Central France, "Je
vous prends sans vert"&mdash;"I catch you without green." The game, however,
is not merely a children's sport, and is played differently from our
description. At Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Inde it is during Lent, and only after the
singing of the <i>Angelus</i>, that "green" is played. If any lady accost you
and shows you her bough, you must immediately exhibit yours. If you
have not such a one, or if your green is of a shade less rich than your adversary's,
you lose a point; in case of doubt, the matter is referred to
an umpire. The game was much in vogue from the thirteenth to the
fourteenth century, and is described as a May-game. "During the first
days of May, every one took care to carry on his person a little green
bough, and those who were not so provided were liable to hear themselves
addressed, <i>I catch you without green</i>, and to receive, at the same instant, a
pail of water on the head. This amusement, however, was in use only
among the members of certain societies, who took the name of <i>Sans-vert</i>.
Those who belonged to these had a right to visit each other at any hour
of the day, and administer the bath whenever they found each other unprovided.
In addition, the members so surprised were condemned to a pecuniary
fine, and the income of these fines was devoted to merry repasts which,
at certain seasons of the year, united all the comrades of the <i>Sans-vert</i>."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The practice has given to the French language a proverb: <i>to take any
one without green</i>, to take him unawares.</p>

<p>Our child's game was doubtless imported by Huguenot immigrants,
who established themselves in the states referred to two centuries since,
where they long preserved their language and customs, and from whom
many well-known families are descended.</p>

<i>My Household.</i></h3>

<p>The names of animals being distributed among children, one, in the
centre of the ring, sings the words; at the proper point the child who
represents the animal must imitate its cry; and as at each verse the animals
who have already figured join in, the game becomes rather noisy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had a little rooster, and my rooster pleased me,<br /></span>

<p>And so on with the names of other beasts.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Georgia.</i></p>

<p>In another version, it is under the "green bay-tree" (<i>Magnolia glauca</i>)
that the animals are stabled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is another of the games which have been widely distributed
through Europe, and date back to a remote past. At present, with us it is
a child's jest, the noisy imitation of animal cries; but, as in all such cases,
sense preceded sound. Comparing German versions, we see that our game
is properly a song, the idea of which consists in the enumeration by significant
and comical names of the members and possessions of a family.
"When I was a poor woman, I went over the Rhine: my goose was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
<i>Wag-tail</i>, my maid <i>So he said</i>, my pig <i>Lard-pot</i>, my flea <i>Hop-i'-straw</i>" etc.
A more courtly version gives us a pleasing pilgrim's song: "Whence
come you?&mdash;From sunset. Whither will you?&mdash;To sunrise. To what
country?&mdash;Home. Where is it?&mdash;A hundred miles away. What is your
name?&mdash;The world names me <i>Leap a-field</i>, my sword is <i>Honor worth</i>, my
wife <i>Pastime</i>, her maid <i>Lie-a-bed</i>, my child <i>Rush-about</i>," etc.</p>

<p>Thus we see the ancient earnestness appearing behind the modern
mirth. It is likely that the origin of the song would take us back to
those lists of mythical titles which were regarded as conveying real
knowledge of the relations of things, at a time when a large part of learning
consisted in the knowledge of the significant names which were given
to objects.</p>

<h3>No. 53.<br />

<i>King and Queen.</i></h3>

<p>This game is now a mere jest. A row of chairs is so arranged as to
leave a vacant space, which is concealed by shawls or other coverings, and
represents a throne. The courtiers having taken their places, the newly
elected monarch is ceremoniously seated by the side of his consort, and
the fun consists in witnessing his downfall.</p>

<p>By Strutt's description, it appears that in the beginning of the century
this was in use as a species of "hazing" in English girls' schools:</p>

<p>"In some great boarding-schools for the fair sex it is customary, upon
the introduction of a novice, for the scholars to receive her with much
pretended solemnity, and decorate a throne in which she is to be installed,
in order to hear a set speech, addressed to her by one of the young ladies in
the name of the rest. The throne is wide enough for three persons to sit
conveniently, and is made with two stools, having a tub nearly filled with
water between them, and the whole is covered with a counterpane or
blanket, ornamented with ribands and other trifling fineries, and drawn
very tightly over the two stools, upon each of which a lady is seated to
keep the blanket from giving way when the new scholar takes her place;
and these are called her maids of honor. The speech consists of high-flown
compliments calculated to flatter the vanity of the stranger; and as
soon as it is concluded, the maids of honor rising suddenly together, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
counterpane of course gives way, and poor miss is unexpectedly immerged
in the water."</p>

<p>In Austria the same game is called "conferring knighthood." All
present are dressed as knights, in paper helmets, great mustachios, sticks
for lances, wooden swords, etc. Two, who represent the oldest knights,
are seated on the two stools, between which is a vacant space, while the
rest form a half-circle about the <i>Grand Master</i>, who wears a mask and
wig, and holds a great roll of paper. Meanwhile the candidate, in a separate
room, is prepared by two knights for the ceremony; these instruct
him in his behavior, until the embassy arrives to lead him before the
Grand Master. The latter delivers a solemn address, and from the document
in his hands reads the rule of the order&mdash;silence, courage, truth,
etc. Then follows the vow, the delivery of the knightly costume, and
the solemn bestowal of the stroke which dubs the victim a knight. He
is finally invited to take his seat in the circle, with the result described in
our own jest.</p>

<p>The name, "King and Queen," recalls a game as old as history, that
of electing a king, who proceeded to confer offices of state, and assign
duties. Herodotus tells us how the child Cyrus showed his royal birth by
the severity with which he punished his disobedient subjects. In Switzerland,
the children still choose, by "counting out," a king and an executioner.
The king proceeds to impose tasks. Geiler of Kaisersberg, in a
sermon, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1507, gives the formula then in use in the game: "Sir king,
I wish to serve you." "And what is your service?" "What you command
me, I would execute." "I bid you do an honor to the king." For
this game, as still played in Switzerland, a queen is also chosen; after a
time, the king exclaims, "I make a journey," when the whole company,
in couples, follow him through the chambers of the house or streets of the
town on his royal progress. The old English game of "Questions and
Commands" seems to have been the same. A writer in the <i>Gentlemen's
Magazine</i>, February, 1738, gives its formula: "King I am," says one boy;
another answers, "I am your man." Then his majesty demands what
service will he do him; to which the obsequious courtier replies, "The
best, and worst, and all I can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>


<h3>No. 54.<br />

<i>Follow Your Leader.</i></h3>

<p>In this game, the leader having been chosen by "speaking first," or
"counting out," the rest must do whatever he does. It is usually played
out-of-doors, and the children "follow their leader" in a row, across roads,
fences, and ditches, jumping from heights, and creeping under barriers.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
We are told that the game is played in a peculiarly reckless fashion in the
South, where the leader will sometimes go under a horse's legs or between
the wheels of a wagon, whereupon the driver, knowing what to expect,
will stop for the rest.</p>

<p>No doubt this sport, now a mere exhibition of daring, has an ancient
origin and history. Perhaps it was a development of the <i>king game</i>,
already referred to.</p>

<p>The technical word for challenge among children in America is
"stump." One boy "stumps" another to do a thing. Whence derived?</p>


<h3>No. 55.<br />

<i>Truth.</i></h3>

<p>The game of "Truth," as played in Massachusetts, is described by Miss
Alcott in her "Little Women," chapter xii. The players are there said to
pile up their hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and the person
who draws his or her hand from the pile at the number selected has
to answer truly any questions put by the rest.</p>

<p>We have heard of a party of young people who met regularly to play
this game, but have been assured that it proved prolific of quarrels.</p>


<h3>No. 56.<br />

<i>Initiation.</i></h3>

<p>We have seen that the imitation of the ceremony of knighthood is still
a form of childish amusement in Europe. Here follows a jesting New
England formula for such a purpose, though not a game of children, but
belonging to an older age:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>"You must promise to obey three rules: first, never to do to-day what
you can put off till to-morrow; secondly, never to eat brown bread when
you can get white; thirdly, never to kiss the maid when you can kiss the
mistress, unless the maid is prettier than the mistress."</p>

<p>These vows having been taken, it is then said, "Now I dub you
knight of the whistle." Meantime a whistle having been attached to the
back of the candidate, the fun consists in his attempts to discover the
person who blew it.</p>


<h3>No. 57.<br />

<i>Judge and Jury.</i></h3>

<p>A child is chosen to be judge, two others for jurors (or, to speak with
our little informant, <i>juries</i>), who sit at his right and left hand.</p>

<p>Each child must ask the permission of the judge before taking any
step. A platter is brought in, and a child, rising, asks the judge, "May I
go into the middle of the room?" "May I turn the platter?" "On
which side shall it fall?"</p>

<p>If the platter falls on the wrong side, forfeit must be paid.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cambridge, Mass.</i></p>

<p>The nursery, we see, does not understand republicanism. The fairy
tale has never got beyond the period in which the monarch orders the
wicked witch to immediate execution.</p>

<p>In the ancient world, however, where the courts were a place of resort,
and law was not a specialized profession, the case was different. Maximus
of Tyre tells us that the children had their laws and tribunals; condemnation
extended to the forfeiture of toys. Cato the Younger, according
to Plutarch, had his detestation of tyranny first awakened by the punishment
inflicted on a playmate by such a tribunal. One of the younger
boys had been sentenced to imprisonment; the doom was duly carried into
effect, but Cato, moved by his cries, rescued him.</p>

<p>In a German game there is a king, a judge, an executioner, an accuser,
and a thief. The parts are assigned by drawing lots, but the accuser does
not know the name of the thief, and, if he makes an error, has to undergo
the penalty in his stead. The judge finally addresses the king, inquiring
if his majesty approves of his decision; and the king replies, "Yes, your
sentence entitles you to my favor;" or, "No, your sentence entitles you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to so many blows." Thus we see how modern child's play respects the
dignity of the king as the fountain of law.</p>

<p>In a Swiss sport the thief flies, and is chased over stock and stone until
caught, when he is made to kneel down, his cap pushed over his brows,
and his head immediately struck off with the edge of a board. So is preserved
the memory of the severity of ancient criminal law.</p>

<i>Three Jolly Sailors.</i></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here comes a set of jolly sailor-boys,<br /></span>

<p>At the second verse, the little girls by whom this round is danced turn
so as to follow each other in an endless chain, each grasping the skirts of
the child in front, while they move faster and faster to the lively tune.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may think this song not a very creditable specimen
of modern invention; but it is no doubt a relic of antiquity. A
similar round, given in "Deuteromelia," 1609 (as cited by Chappell),
begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We be three poor mariners, newly come from the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spend our lives in jeopardy, while others live at ease.<br /></span>

<p>The children of the poorer class, therefore, who still keep up in the
streets of our cities the present ring-dance, are only maintaining the
customs which belonged to courtiers and noble ladies in the time of
Shakespeare.</p>

<i>Marching to Quebec.</i></h3>

<p>This piece of doggerel may be of revolutionary origin, as it can be
traced to near the beginning of the present century. It is unusual for
political or military events to be alluded to in children's games.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As we were marching to Quebec,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">March! march! march! march!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So the game was played in Philadelphia in the childhood of a lady
born at the end of the last century. In Massachusetts and Maine it continued
to be popular until within a few years, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">The kiss is most sincerely.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Worcester, Mass.</i></p>

<p>That the population of Dutch extraction in New York had no deep
sympathy with the patriotic sentiments of revolutionary times seems to
be indicated in a satirical stanza, which has come to us from an informant
who learned it in youth of her aged grandmother, and which appears
also to have been originally a dance-song. We hope that errors in
spelling American Dutch may be forgiven:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Loope, Junger, de roier kome&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spann de wagen voor de Paarde!<br /></span>

<p>That is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Run, lads, the king's men are coming;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harness the wagons before the horses!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in jesting allusion to the speed with which the patriots were supposed to
make off. The refrain is in part unintelligible to us, but seems to belong
to a dance.</p>

<i>Sudden Departure.</i></h3>

<p>A visitor approaches the ring from without, and pleads:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">So pray, little girl, let me in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll light my pipe, and warm my toes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then I'll be gone again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He is admitted into the circle, and proceeds to perform the designated
actions. Having "lighted his pipe and warmed his toes," he suddenly
attempts to make his exit from the ring (all the members of which have
clasped hands in expectation of his onset), throwing himself with that
object against a pair of linked arms.</p>


<h3>No. 61.<br />

<i>Scorn.</i></h3>

<p>Such was, and perhaps still is, the name of an amusement of a not
very agreeable nature, familiar at children's parties in New England. A
girl was seated on a chair in the middle of the room, and one child after
another was led to her throne. She would turn away with an expression
of contempt, until some one approached that pleased her, who, after a
kiss, took her place.</p>

<p>"Derision" is the name of a game mentioned by Froissart as an
amusement of his childhood. It is not at all unlikely that the present
sport represents the old French pastime.</p>

<p>Speaking of representations of the passions, we may say that we have
heard of a game formerly played in New York, called "Hatred and Revenge;"
but have not succeeded in obtaining it.</p>

<p>A girl is chosen to be the <i>Ocean</i>. The rest represent <i>rivers</i>. The
rivers, by very devious courses (around school-desks, etc.), flow into the
Ocean. Not unfrequently in their course to the sea, the rivers encounter
somewhat violently.</p>

<p>We may add here an unnamed amusement for school-girls, which consists
in joining hands behind the back (giving the right hand to the left
hand of a partner), and then turning, while retaining the hold, so as to
stand facing each other. This movement is then repeated until the couple
whirl about with considerable rapidity.</p>

<em class="gesperrt"><i>Club Fist.</i></em></h3>

<p>A child lays on a table his clenched fist, with the thumb elevated;
another grasps the raised thumb with his own fist, and so on until a pile
of fists is built up. A player, who remains apart from the group, then
addresses the child whose hand is at the top:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What's that?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A pear."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Take it off or I'll knock it off."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same conversation is repeated with the next child, and so on; the
fist being withdrawn as speedily as possible, to escape a rap from the
questioner. When only one is left, the following dialogue ensues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"What have you got there?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Bread and cheese."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's my share?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Cat's got it."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the cat?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"In the woods."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the woods?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Fire burned it."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the fire?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Water quenched it."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the water?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Ox drank it."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the ox?"<br /></span>

<span class="i22">"Where's the butcher?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Rope hung him."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the rope?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Rat gnawed it."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the rat?"<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Cat caught it."<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Where's the cat?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Behind the church-door. The first who laughs, or grins, or shows the
teeth has three pinches and three knocks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then follows a general scattering; for some child is sure to laugh, and if
he does not do so of his own accord, his neighbors will certainly tweak
him, poke him, or otherwise excite his risibility.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Georgia.</i></p>

<p>In Pennsylvania the conversation ends:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Where's the butcher?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He's behind the door cracking nuts, and whoever speaks first I'll slap his fingers,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Because I am the keeper of the keys,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And I do whatever I please."<br /></span>

<p>This dialogue, based on a well-known nursery tale, has maintained itself
with remarkable persistence, and even verbal identity, in several European
languages. We meet it in Germany and Denmark, as well as England.</p>


<h3>No. 76.<br />

<i>Robin's Alive.</i></h3>

<p>This celebrated game was formerly much played in New England during
the winter evenings. A stick was lighted, and passed from hand to
hand. It was an object to transfer it as quickly as possible; but each
player, before handing it to his neighbor, must repeat the rhyme&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bird is alive, and alive like to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it dies in my hand you may back-saddle me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or else, "Robin's alive," etc.</p>

<p>The "back-saddling" consisted in depositing the person, in whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
hand the light went out, upon the back on the floor, and afterwards piling
upon him (or her) chairs and other furniture.</p>

<p>Another formula is given in the "Girls' Own Book:"</p>

<p>"Robin's alive, and alive he shall be; if he dies in my hand, my mouth
shall be bridled, my back shall be saddled, and I be sent home to the
king's Whitehall."</p>

<p>When the light expired it was said: "Robin is dead, and dead he shall
be; he has died in your hand, and your mouth shall be bridled, your back
shall be saddled, to send you home to the king's Whitehall."</p>

<p>This game is played all over Europe with similar formulas; but we
are not aware that the "back-saddling" feature has been practised out of
England and America. The person in whose possession the light is extinguished
usually pays forfeit.</p>

<p>It has been suggested, with plausibility, that the sport is connected
with an ancient rite: namely, the races of torch-bearers, which formed
part of certain festal ceremonies, and in which the courier in whose hands
the torch went out was a loser. Such contests are repeatedly alluded to
by classic writers; but their exact conduct is involved in some obscurity.
In such a race, at Athens, the torch was kindled on the altar of Prometheus,
and handed to the runner, whose duty it was to pass it, while still
alight, to a second, and so on. This ceremony has suggested a celebrated
line to Lucretius, who compares the flying ages to "runners who pass
from one to another the torch of life."</p>


<h3>No. 77.<br />

<i>Laughter Games.</i></h3>

<p>There is a whole class of games of which the object is to excite to
laughter by means of some ridiculous action.</p>

<p>Such games are sometimes played with a lighted candle. The players
approach each other from opposite sides of the room, and sustain a dialogue
in solemn tones, while they must keep a grave countenance on
penalty of paying forfeit. For example:</p>

<p>"The king of Turkey is dead." "What did he die of?" "Doing
so" (some ridiculous gesture).</p>

<p>A more characteristic version (in Nantucket, Mass.) had it: "The royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Russian princess, Husty Fusty, is defunct." To which it was necessary
to answer soberly&mdash;"I'm very sorry to hear it; even the cats bewail her
loss."</p>

<p>A game which was formerly popular with children in Massachusetts
was to lean a staff in the corner, while a player was seated in the centre of
the ring. Another child now entered, took up the staff, approached and
addressed the one sitting, and a rhymed dialogue ensued:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My father sent me here with a staff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak to you, and not to laugh."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Methinks you smile." "Methinks I don't.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I smooth my face with ease and grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set my staff in its proper place."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the staff-bearer laughed, he or she must take the chair; otherwise
the next player continued the game.</p>

<p>A third amusement is for girls to excite one another to laugh by
gently pinching in succession the ears, nose, lips, etc., while making use
of some ridiculous expression.</p>

<p>This usage is alluded to more than three centuries ago by Rabelais.</p>

<p>In a Swiss game, this performance is complicated by a jest. Each
child pinches his neighbor's ear; but by agreement the players blacken
their fingers, keeping two of the party in ignorance. Each of the two
victims imagines it to be the other who is the object of the uproarious
mirth of the company.</p>


<h3>No. 78.<br />

<i>Bachelor's Kitchen.</i></h3>

<p>The children sit in a row, with the exception of one, who goes in succession
to each child, and asks him what he will give to the bachelor's
kitchen. Each answers what he pleases, as a saucepan, a mousetrap, etc.
When all have replied, the questioner returns to the first child, and puts
all sorts of questions, which must be answered by the article which he before
gave to the kitchen, and by no other word. For instance, he asks,
"What do you wear on your head?" "Mousetrap." The object is to
make the answerer laugh, and he is asked a number of questions, until he
either laughs or is given up as a hard subject. The questioner then passes
to the next child, and so on through the whole row. Those who laugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
or add any other word to their answer, must pay a forfeit, which is redeemed
in the same way as in other games.</p>

<i>The Church and the Steeple.</i></h3>

<p>Little girls, with appropriate motions of the closed fist, or of the

<p>An Italian finger-game well exhibits the different mental state of children
in the two countries. The words are: "This is the Inferno, and this the
Paradiso." The fingers of the two hands, crossed within, represent the
disturbed world of wretchedness; the back of the hands, turned, where
all is calm, typify Paradise.</p>


<h3>No. 80.<br />

<i>What Color?</i></h3>

<p>A tumbler of water and a thimble are required. One child is sent
out of the room, and to each of the others a different color is allotted.
The first is then expected to name the color of some child. If she succeeds
in her guess, a thimbleful of water is thrown in her face. The
guessing is continued till this takes place, when the thrower becomes the
guesser for the next turn.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cincinnati.</i></p>


<h3>No. 81.<br />

<i>Beetle and Wedge.</i></h3>

<p>There are games in which the guesser has only <i>Scogan's choice</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> between
two sorts of disaster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus, a party of boys pitch on two who are unacquainted with the
game, and ask them if they would not like to play "Beetle and Wedge."
"The fun is to be the Beetle and the Wedge," they explain. The victims
consenting, the Beetle is then driven against the Wedge, back to
back, with a force that "sends him flying." This amusement belongs to
Connecticut.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia a boy is asked whether he prefers <i>mustard</i> or <i>pepper</i>;
in either case receiving corresponding personal inflictions. So in the English
game of "Trades" a boy is made to guess the trade of the questioner,
and is <i>hammered</i>, <i>planed</i>, or <i>rasped</i>, accordingly.</p>


<h3>No. 82.<br />

<i>Present and Advise.</i></h3>

<p>All the children, except two, are seated in a row. One of these whispers
in the ear of each child, "I present you with this." The second, in
like manner, adds, "I advise you what to do with it."</p>

<p>Another old whispering-game, belonging, like the preceding, to New
York, is called "Sentiment." Each child tells his neighbor on the right
the name of a person, and repeats to the one on the left a verse of poetry,
usually of a sentimental character. The name and verse are then to be
repeated together as in the former game.</p>


<h3>No. 83.<br />

<i>Genteel Lady.</i></h3>

<p>"I, genteel lady, always genteel, come from the genteel lady, always
genteel, beg leave to inform you that my ship has just come in from China
laden with apricots."</p>

<p>The next player has to repeat, adding some object beginning with <i>b</i>,
such as biscuit; the next player one beginning with <i>c</i>, and so down the
alphabet. If any one hesitates, or makes a mistake, a lighted "lamp-lighter"
(New England, <i>spill</i>) is stuck in her hair, and she is the "one-horned,"
instead of the "genteel" lady; and for two mistakes the "two-horned"
lady, and so on. This juxtaposition of curls and "lamp-lighters"
is by no means always safe.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Georgia.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

must answer in the given time the name of some animal of the kind
required, not already cited by some other player.</p>

<p>Whoever fails to reply while the counting is going on, is out of the
game. After the names of commoner animals are exhausted, the game
becomes a test of quickness and memory.</p>


<h3>No. 85.<br />

<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i></h3>

<p>A picture of a wheel is drawn upon the slate, and a number written
between each of its spokes. The eyes being then closed, the child whose
turn it is raises a pencil in the air, twirling it, and saying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Tit for tat,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Butter for fat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you kill my dog I'll kill your cat.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the last word the pencil is brought down; if the point of the pencil
falls on a space, the number there written is scored; if on a line, or outside
the circle, or on a number previously secured (and erased by a line), the
turn is forfeited. The game is continued until a certain number has been
scored by the winning player.</p>

<p>Equally well known is the jest, "I am a gold lock," "I am a gold
key," etc.&mdash;ending "I am a monk-lock," "I am a mon-key."</p>

<p>We may mention also a familiar catch, "Say my cat, my cat, and not
my dog." "My dog" must not be spoken.</p>

<p>Of a different character are the following jests:</p>

<p>The lights being extinguished, a knife is passed round the circle of
players, and the following conversation ensues, each phrase being continued
from left to right of the ring:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">"A dagger."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where did you get it?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Stole it."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What was done with it?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All of the company who understand the jest shriek aloud, which accomplishes
the object of terrifying the rest.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar (in New York) is the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Neighbor, I've got a hatchet to sell."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Did you buy it?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Sh&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following conversation, one sentence at a time is repeated in a
whisper to the left-hand neighbor, and so passed round the circle, the fun
consisting in the imitation of crowing at the end.</p>

<p>"Hath she feathers?" "Feathers she hath." "Doth she crow?"
"Crow she doth." "How doth she crow?" (An imitation of crowing
follows.)</p>

<i>Intery Mintery.</i></h3>

<p>An evening amusement formerly common in Massachusetts. All
present laid their hands with fingers resting on the knees. The speaker
then told off the words of the rhyme, one for each finger. The rhyme
being thus recited, that finger to which the last syllable fell must be
quickly withdrawn, on penalty of being sharply rapped by the hand of
the leader. After all had been counted out but one person, he or she
was liable to the same risk for every word of the rhyme&mdash;the result of

<p>Another formula, used in the Middle and Southern States, is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Heavy, heavy, what hangs over you?"<br /></span>

<p>The German usage is nearly the same, the question being "Lord

my hand?"</p>

<p>The following are examples of old penalties, which usually involved
kissing, with infinite variety of method:</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><i>To go to Rome.</i> To kiss every girl in the room.</p>

<p><i>Flat-irons.</i> The lad and lass lay their hands on the wall and kiss.</p>

<p><i>Measuring yards of tape, and cutting it off.</i> To kiss with the arms extended.</p>

<p>"<i>I'm in the well.</i>" "How many fathoms deep?" (Any number is answered.)</p>

<p>"Whom will you have to take you out?" (Some one of
the company is named.) Each fathom represents a kiss.</p></div>

<i>Old Mother Tipsy-toe.</i></h3>

<p>This is a very popular game with girls in various parts of the United
States.</p>

<p>The children sit in a row, with the exception of the mother, who comes
up and asks each child in turn, "How did you tear your dress?" After
hearing their various excuses, she again traverses the row, indicating the
part of the dress to be mended, and saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I give you so much work to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use thimble, thread, and needle too;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">If you don't get it done before I come back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll give you a slap across your back.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She slaps her children on the shoulder and goes out, forbidding them to
follow her. As soon as her back is turned, they all jump up and run after
her, shouting, "Old mother Tipsy-toe,"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> or, as in a variation from New
York:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old mother Tippety-toe, old mother Tippety-toe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll follow my mother wherever she go.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mother now goes into a shop, and orders various articles, the children
repeating after her whatever she says. For instance, the mother says, "I
want two pounds of butter." "I want two pounds of butter," shout the
children in chorus. Finally she says, "And I want a stick to whip my
children with," upon which she turns to leave the shop, while the children
rush before her, and scramble back to their seats before their mother
comes home. The latter then goes to each child in turn, saying, "Let me
see how well you have mended your dress." The children all hold the
hem of their dresses as firmly as they can, with their hands somewhat
apart. The mother strikes with her hand the part of the dress that is between
their hands; and if they let it go, she scolds and beats them for
their bad mending.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cambridge, Mass.</i></p>

<p>In another way of playing, which makes the game one of chase, "Old
mammy Tipsy-toe" addresses her children:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I give you this much work to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Use thread and needle, thimble too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you don't have it done<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the time that I come home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll be beaten black and blue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With my old shoe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She then makes preparations to depart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm going to Lady Washington's,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To get a cup of tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And five loaves of gingerbread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So don't you follow me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The children, of course, pursue her with shouts of defiance, upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>she turns and chases them, while they rush to their places. She comes
back, and demands of the children:</p>

<p>"Have you been out to-day?" "No." "You have. Where have
you been?" "To grandmother's." "What did you get?" "A slice of
cake." "Where is my share?" "In the band-box." "But I might break
my neck getting it." "I wish you would." On this, she chases the children,
who fly and scatter. Any child she catches is out of the game,
which is continued until all are captured.</p>

<i>Who Stole the Cardinal's Hat?</i></h3>

<p>The children being seated in a circle, a child, who does not take part
in the game, whispers to each of the rest a name representing some color,
as "Red-cap," "Blue-cap," "Yellow-cap," etc. Two players are excepted,
one of whom is called "My man John," and one represents the cardinal.
The latter now leaves the room, first placing in the hands of "John" a
little billet of wood, bidding him take care of the Cardinal's hat, which at
the same time he declares to be of some particular color, as green. "John"
conceals this somewhere in the room. The child who went out then enters,
armed with a cane, and demands the Cardinal's hat. "John" affects
to have forgotten all about it, and asks, "What color was it? green?" and
so on until he guesses the color. Being thus reminded, he declares
that some one of the group, as, for example, "Red-cap," has stolen it.
"Red-cap" is now asked by the questioner, "Red-cap, did you steal the
Cardinal's hat?" He also must pass on the charge, saying, "No, it was
White-cap" (or any other color). If he omits to do so, or names a color
not included among the players, he must pay forfeit. Meanwhile the questioner
becomes indignant at the numerous denials, and proceeds to extort
confession by torture, rapping with his cane the fingers of those whom he
addresses. If he succeeds in obliging any child to confess, the latter must
pay forfeit. At last "My man John" owns the theft, produces the hat,
and the game is begun again, until a sufficient number of forfeits have
been collected.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Saratoga, New York.</i></p>

<p>This game is also played in Switzerland. The name of a color having
been given to each child, a ball is stealthily passed about the circle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"Abbot of St. Gall" enters, and exclaims, "The Abbot of St. Gall has
lost his night-cap; they say White stole it." The player whose color is
named, if he has the ball, must pass it behind his back to another, saying,
"Not White, Red has it." Whoever is caught in passing the ball, or
names a color not in the game, or fails to answer when his name is called,
must pay forfeit, or have his face marked with burned cork. It will be
seen that the Swiss game corresponds to the American, except that in the
latter the ball is concealed instead of being passed round; but we think it
likely that the memory of our informant (a child) may have been at fault
in this respect.</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, February, 1738, mentions a game called
"The Parson hath lost his Fuddling Cap." <i>The Spectator</i>, No. 268, also
refers to this sport: "I desire to know in your next if the merry game
of 'The Parson has lost his Cloak,' is not mightily in vogue amongst the
fine ladies this Christmas, because I see they wear hoods of all colours,
which I suppose is for that purpose." From this last extract it appears
that the names "Red-cap," etc., are a reminiscence of the variously colored
hoods once employed in the game.</p>

<i>GUESSING-GAMES.</i></h2>


<p>"As boys, when they play at 'how many,' hold out their hands in such a way
that, having few, they pretend to have many, and having many, they make believe
to have few."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Xenophon</span>, <i>Treatise on the Duties of a Cavalry Officer</i>.</p>

<h3>No. 91.<br />

<i>Odd or Even.</i></h3>

<p>A small number of beans or other counters are held in the hand, and
the question is, Odd or Even? If the guess is even, and the true number
odd, it is said "Give me one to make it odd," and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The game is
continued until all the counters belong to one or other of the two players.</p>

<p>This amusement was familiar in ancient Greece and Rome, as it is in
modern Europe. In the classic game the player gained or lost as many
as he held in his hand.</p>


<h3>No. 92.<br />

<i>Hul Gul.</i></h3>

<p>This game is played by three, four, or more, who stand in a circle. A
child then addresses his left-hand neighbor, and the dialogue is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hul Gul."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hands full."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Parcel how many?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second player then guesses the number, two guesses being sometimes
allowed. If, for example, the guess is five, and the real number seven,
the first responds, "Give me two to make it seven," and so on until all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the counters have been gained by one player. The number allowed to be
taken is often limited, by agreement, to six or ten.</p>

<p>The counters are beans, grains of corn, marbles, nuts, and, in the
South, <i>chinquapins</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>A childish trick is to expand the hand as if unable to hold the number
of counters, when in fact they are but one or two. Oddly enough,
this same device is alluded to by Xenophon as in use in his day in the
game of "How many?"&mdash;the classic equivalent of our game, in which the
question was, "How many have I in the hand?" just as we say, "Parcel
how many?" So, in these sports, the interval of two thousand years
vanishes.</p>


<h3>No. 93.<br />

<i>How many Fingers?</i></h3>

<p>A child hides his head on another's lap, and guesses the number of
fingers raised. We find a rhyme for this given in the "Girls' Own Book."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mingledy, mingledy, clap, clap, clap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many fingers do I hold up?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Three."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Three you said, and two it was," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another form of this game consists in schoolboys mounting on each
other's back and raising fingers, of which the number is to be guessed.
The English formula for this purpose is given by Tylor thus, "Buck,
buck, how many horns do I hold up?" We are not aware that the
practice continues to exist in this country.</p>

<p>In the famous finger-game of "Morra," the sum of the fingers raised
by the two players is counted. The game is played with such rapidity,
and the calling is so rapid, that conjecture plays a larger part in the game
than eyesight. "Morra" has been a favorite for nearly four thousand
years, for it is represented on early Egyptian monuments, where the players
are depicted as using the right hand, and scoring with the left, very
much as is done in the south of Europe at the present day.</p>

<p>It is very likely, however, that the nursery usage we are now concerned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>with is as old. Petronius Arbiter, in the time of Nero, describes Trimalchio
as so playing with a boy. The latter, mounting as on horseback,
smote his shoulders with the open hand, and laughing said, "Bucca, bucca,
how many?"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>We will not undertake to decide whether the reported coincidence of
the Latin and English formulas is a genuine example of transmission.
The game, however, and the question, "How many?" have certainly endured
for two thousand years, and very likely existed as long before the
days of Petronius, or from a time as remote as that to which can be traced
the more complicated game of "Morra."</p>

<i>Right or Left.</i></h3>

<p>A common way of deciding a dispute, selecting players, or determining
who shall begin a game, is to take a pebble or other object in the closed
fist, and make a comrade guess in which hand it is contained.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned way of holding the hands, both in England and
Germany, was to place one fist on top of the other; and a like usage formerly
prevailed in New England, though we have not met with the English
rhyme:</p>

<i>Comes, it Comes.</i></h3>

<p>A simple guessing-game, familiar to children in New England. One
child of the party says to another, "It comes, it comes." The player addressed
replies, "What do you come by?" The first replies by naming
the initial letter of some object in the room; if, for instance, it is the
table he has in mind, he says, "I come by T." The rest must now guess
what thing, beginning with this letter, is meant.</p>


<h3>No. 97.<br />

<i>Hold Fast My Gold Ring.</i></h3>

<p>The children sit in a circle, with hands closed; one takes the ring,
and goes around with it, tapping the closed fists of the players as if
inserting the ring, and saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Biddy, biddy, hold fast my gold ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I go to London, and come back again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Each child, in turn, is then required to guess who has the ring, and, if
successful, takes the leader's place; if unsuccessful, he pays forfeit.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Georgia.</i></p>

<p>This is known in Massachusetts as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Button, button, who's got the button?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another form of the question is, "Fox, fox, who's got the box?"</p>

<p>In England the game goes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>No. 98.<br />

<i>My Lady Queen Anne.</i></h3>

<p>A ball is concealed with some one of the children who form the circle.
A girl is placed in the centre, and a dialogue ensues; the ring singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"My lady Queen Anne,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">She sits in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">As fair as a lily,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">As brown as a bun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king sends you three letters, and bids you read one."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The girl answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I cannot read one unless I read all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pray, Mr. [or Miss] &mdash;&mdash;, deliver the ball."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the person named has the ball, he or she takes her place; if not, she
continues as before. In England, a rhyme is given for the latter case:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The ball is mine, and none of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So you, proud queen, may sit on your throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we, your messengers, go and come."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>No. 99.<br />

<i>The Wandering Dollar.</i></h3>

<p>A coin is passed about the circle, and the central player is to guess
who has it. The dollar is held in the palm, then passed about the ring by
each player alternately clapping his hands together, and then extending
his arms so as to touch the hands of his neighbor. For this purpose the
right hand should be held downward, and the left turned upward, as the
arms are extended. The coin is to be <i>palmed</i> from hand to hand, and the
rhythmical motions being accompanied with song (to almost any tune)
make a very pretty game, but one which requires much practice to master.
The verse sung is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dollar, dollar, how you wander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the one unto the other!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>

<span class="i0">To leave Miss [Anna] so long without a chair?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Cincinnati.</i></p>

<p>The game is a modern translation from the German, presumably by
the children themselves.</p>


<h3>No. 100.<br />

<i>Thimble in Sight.</i></h3>

<p>Among games of search may be mentioned the present, in which, the
greater part of the company being sent out of the room, a thimble must
be placed so as to escape notice, and yet in such a position as to be visible
when the attention is once directed to it. As each of the party discovers
the thimble, he indicates his success by saying "Rorum torum corum,"
or some such formula, and then takes his seat.</p>

<p>In other games, in which some small object is hidden, there are various
ways of assisting the seeker when at fault; thus, it is said you <i>freeze</i>,
you are <i>cold</i>, you are <i>warm</i>, you <i>burn</i>, according as the object is approached;
or the search is directed by <i>magical music</i>, which grows louder
as the person comes nearer to his object. These usages belong also to
other countries. More original is a practice, common in Massachusetts,
according to which the height of the concealed object above the floor of
the room is indicated by the words "So high water," addressed by one of
the company to the person who has been sent out, as he enters and begins
his search.</p>

<i>How many Miles to Babylon?</i></h3>

<p>A party of young people stand at each end of a space, such as a portico,
a field, etc., and a single player is stationed in the middle. The
former address the latter:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Marlow, marlow, marlow bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many miles to Babylon?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Threescore and ten."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Can I get there by candlelight?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yes, if your legs are as long as light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But take care of the old gray witch by the road-side."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The players at the ends of the field then run from side to side, and
must be caught by the central player, whom they then assist to catch the
rest.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Georgia.</i></p>

<p>This sport, which has been universally familiar in America, is a form
of the old English game of "Barley Break," and probably the "marlow
bright" of our version is a corruption of that name.</p>

<p>The Scotch variety given by Chambers has a very chivalric turn, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
may give an idea of the song which must have accompanied the game in
the time of Queen Elizabeth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"King and queen of Cantelon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many miles to Babylon?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Eight and eight, and other eight."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Will I get there by candlelight?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If your horse be good and your spurs be bright."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How many men have ye?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mae nor ye daur come and see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poets of the Elizabethan age fully describe the game of "Barley
Break," and seem to think it the most delightful of youthful amusements.
They represent Diana and her nymphs as amusing themselves with this
sport.</p>

<p>It appears from Sidney's description that the game was played by three
couples, each of a youth and a maid, one couple standing at each end of
the area, and the third remaining in the centre. The mating was determined
by lot, and the last pair mated were obliged to take the central position,
and saluted each other by a kiss. This pair were required to pursue
with joined hands, while the others were at liberty to separate. Any maid
caught replaced the maid, and any youth the youth, of the central couple.
Notwithstanding the courtly nature of the sport, that its fundamental idea
is the same as that of our game appears by the name of the central space,
as Sidney gives it in the "Arcadia:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then couples three be streight allotted there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They of both ends the middle two do flie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two that in mid-place Hell called were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must strive with waiting foot and watching eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch of them, and them to Hell to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they, as well as they, Hell may supplie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A New England variation introduces blindfolding, thus adapting the
game to a chamber. Two children are made to kneel on stools, their eyes
bandaged, and the rest must run between. The dialogue is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How many miles to Barbary-cross?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fourscore."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Are there any bears in the way?"<br /></span>

<p>The ring now halts, and the dialogue proceeds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old buzzard, old buzzard, what are you doing?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Picking up sticks."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Where are you going to get the chicken?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Out of your flock."<br /></span>

<p>The Buzzard gives chase and captures a child. He brings him back,
lays him down, and proceeds to dress him for dinner. All the rest stand
round in admiring silence. The Buzzard asks,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will you be picked or scraped?"<br /></span>

<p>According to the choice he proceeds as if picking the feathers of a bird

<p>In the Southern States a witch takes the place of the bird of prey, and
the rhyme is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Chickamy, chickamy, crany, crow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went to the well to wash my toe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I came back my chicken was gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What o'clock, old witch?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The witch names any hour, and questions and answers are repeated as
before, up to twelve:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What are you doing, old witch?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am making a fire to cook a chicken."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where are you going to get it?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Out of your coop."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I've got the key."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, we'll see who will have it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The witch tries to get past the hen, and seize the last of the line; the
mother, spreading out her arms, bars the passage. The witch cries,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I must have a chick."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You sha'n't have a chick."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Each child caught drops out, and as the line grows shorter the struggle
becomes desperate.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Georgia.</i></p>

<p>This latter way of playing is the older form of the game, and is also
familiar, though without words, in the North, where it is known as "Fox
and Chickens."</p>

<p>This game is one of the most widely diffused, and the dialogue is
marvellously identical, from Russia to Italy.</p>

<p>In Schleswig-Holstein the conversation runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hawk, what are you lighting?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A fire."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is the fire for?"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"To make ashes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What are the ashes for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To sharpen a knife."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is the knife for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To cut off chickens' heads."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What have the chickens done?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Gone into my master's corn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In our own country, among the Pennsylvania Germans, or, to use their
own agreeable idiom, "De Pennsylfaunisch Deitsch," this game enjoys
the distinction of being almost the only child's game which is accompanied
by words, and is played as follows:</p>

<p>A boy who is digging in the earth is accosted by a second, who carries
a handful of sticks, the longest of which represents the needle:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Woy, woy, was grawbst?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Meine Moder hat erne silberne Nodel verloren."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The stooping child now rises and pursues the rest.</p>

<p>A similar dialogue is used for a game of chase in New York:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old mother, what are you looking for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A needle."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What do you want a needle for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To sew my bag with."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What do you want your bag for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To keep my steel in."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What do you want your steel for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To sharpen my knife to cut off your head."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same spirit, the Venetian game has:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sister, what are you looking for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A knife to kill you with."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>Whereupon she pursues the questioners. In this version we find also the
inquiry about the hour, the putting of the pot on the fire, the searching
for the knife, and final scattering.</p>

<p>The Finns on the Baltic coast, too, have the game in the form of a long
song, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Close together! see the hawk yon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close together! see his talons?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which exactly corresponds to the Scotch,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Keep in, keep in, wherever ye be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greedy gled is seeking ye!<br /></span>

<h3>No. 103.<br />

<i>Tag.</i></h3>

<p>In this game a child, usually selected by "counting out," pursues his
comrades till he has caught one who must replace him. There is generally
some asylum of refuge, where the pursued are safe.</p>

<p>The original form of this game seems to have been "Iron Tag," or
"Tag on Iron," once universal in the United States, and still here and there
played. In Germany and Italy, also, this is the usual form of the sport. In
this game the pursued party is safe whenever touching iron in any shape,
as the ring of a post, horse-shoe, etc.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> A writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
February, 1738, speaking of this amusement, says that "the lad saves
himself by the touching of cold iron," and that "in later times this play
has been altered amongst children of quality, by touching of gold instead
of iron." In like manner, owing to the occasional scarcity of iron objects,
<i>wood-tag</i> and <i>stone-tag</i> have been varieties of the sport in America.</p>

<p>This form of the game exhibits its original meaning. As in several
other games of chase, the pursuer represents an evil spirit, from whose
attack, according to ancient superstition, iron was a protection. Hence
the challenge, in Silesia and Switzerland, is, "Father, I have no iron, hit
me."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The chaser, it seems, was conceived as the aged but powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>dwarf, of malignant character. Thus we get a vivid idea of the extent
to which such representations once affected the lives even of children, and
see that an amusement which is now a mere pleasurable muscular exercise
followed the direction imposed by belief.</p>

<p>There are numerous varieties of this game. In <i>cross-tag</i>, the pursuer
must follow whoever comes between him and the pursued. In <i>squat-tag</i>,
the fugitive is safe while in that position, or is allowed a given number of
"squats," during which he cannot be touched. A peculiar variety (in
Philadelphia) is "Tag, tag, tell a body." In this game every child is forbidden
to tell who is "it," on penalty of replacing him. Sometimes the
name of the pursuer is kept secret until revealed by his actions, or the
child who has been tagged deceives the rest by keeping up his speed.
On the other hand, the catcher is sometimes bound to turn his cap inside
out, whence the game is called <i>turn-cap</i>.</p>

<p>"Pickadill" is a kind of tag played in Massachusetts during the winter.
A large circle is made in the snow, with quartering paths; if there are
many players, two circles are made. There is one tagger, and the centre
is the place of safety.</p>

<p>"London Loo" is a particular species of the game (in Philadelphia) in
which the following: formula is used:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&mdash;London!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Loo!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll try to catch one of you."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>No. 104.<br />

<i>Den.</i></h3>

<p>This is an out-of-doors game. Each boy represents a wild beast, and
has a separate tree, which represents his "den." Any player who leaves
his den is liable to be tagged by any who has started out at a later moment.
The best runner usually ventures first, a second pursues him, and so on,
until all may be out at once. If a player can tag any one whom he has a
right to capture, he takes him home to his own den, and the latter must
help him to take the rest. The pursuer cannot be tagged while bringing
home his prisoner.</p>

<i>I Spy.</i><a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></h3>

<p>This game is world-old and world-wide. To judge by the description
of Pollux (in the second century), it was then played exactly as American
children play it to-day. "One of the party places himself in the middle
of his comrades, and closes his eyes, unless some other covers them for
him. The players run away and scatter. Then the pursuer opens his
eyes and proceeds to look for them. It is each player's object to reach
that one's<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> ground before him."</p>

<p>An ancient painting represents this game. Cupids are playing together.
One of these, with his face turned away, has his hands before
his eyes, and appears to be counting. Another is running to a place of
concealment, while a third peeps from behind the door.</p>

<p>Children, with us, usually count a hundred before beginning the
search; but there is an abbreviated method, not accounted fair&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ten, ten, and double ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forty-five and fifteen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "home" is usually a tree. When the seeker catches sight of any
of the players, he (or she) runs to the tree, and touches it thrice, saying,
"One, two, three, for&mdash;&mdash;" (naming the child). On the other hand, if
the latter can reach the tree first, he touches it, saying, "One, two, three,
for myself."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In a variety of the game, a stick is set up against a tree. One of the
players seizes it, and throws it as far as possible. The children hide,
while the one who happens to be "it" gets and replaces the stick, after
which he proceeds to look for the rest. Those whom he discovers he
captures as above described, until all are taken. If any of the hiders can
reach the tree and throw down the stick, all prisoners are released, and
the seeker must begin over again. A similar game, in New York, is
called "Yards off."</p>

<p>"Hide and Seek" differs only in this, that there is no home to be
touched, but the game is ended when the concealment is discovered.
When the players are hidden they announce it by "whooping."</p>

<i>Sheep and Wolf.</i></h3>

<p>This is a very ancient hiding-game. A wolf is chosen by "counting
out" or otherwise, who conceals himself, and then indicates that he is
ready by howling.</p>

<p>The rest of the party, who are supposed to be sheep, walk round the
corner in a casual way, until one calls out, "I spy a wolf," whereupon all
immediately take to their heels. Whoever is caught by the wolf before
reaching home must take his place for the next turn. This game is
nearly identical in most European countries.</p>

<span class="i2">If you want a pretty girl, pray take that;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">If you want a pretty girl, pray take she.<br /></span>

<p>Lad after lad being successively excluded, the last remaining is "it," and
has to hide himself, when he calls out,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

and tries to touch the latter before he can reach goal, the rule being that</p>

<i>Blind-man's Buff.</i></h3>

<p>A blindfolded player is led into the centre of a room, taken by the
shoulders, and turned about three times, after which he must catch somebody
to replace him.</p>

<p>For this initiation there is in the Middle States a rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How many horses have you in your father's stable?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Three; black, white, and gray."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Turn about, and turn about, and catch whom you may."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The English name, "Hoodman-blind," is derived from the manner of
blindfolding formerly in use. When caps were worn which could be
drawn at will over the face, the caps, reversed so as to cover the countenance,
formed the mask.</p>

<p>This game belongs to all ages and most countries, and is known by
many different names, frequently taken from animals, for example: "Blind
Cow" in Germany; "Blind Goat" in Sweden; "Blind Mouse" in South
Germany and Servia; "Blind Hen" in Spain; "Blind Fly," or "Blind
Cat," in Italy. To the English name, "Blind-man's Buff," correspond the
Polish "Blind Old Man," and the Norwegian "Blind Thief." In these
titles a mythologic allusion is probably contained, which is quite clear in
the Scotch "Belly-blind,"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the latter name representing a malicious demon.
Thus again appears the conception of a supernatural adversary so common
in games of pursuit.</p>

<p>A familiar variation makes this a ring-game. The blindfolded person
stands in the centre, with a staff, while the ring circles about him. When
he strikes the floor three times, the ring must pause. The person in
whose direction he points must grasp the staff, and utter some sound, disguising
the voice as much as possible. The first must then guess the
name from the sound. In New York this form of the game is called
"Peggy in the Ring," and the request is "to squeak."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>In Cincinnati the game is also played in a dark room, without bandaging
the eyes, and is then called "Devil in the Dark."</p>

<p>Another variety, also commonly played without blindfolding, goes
by the name of "Still Pond," or "Still Palm." The child who is "it,"
counting up to ten, says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still proving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No moving.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All now keep their places. The catcher must guess by the touch the
name of his captive.</p>

<p>The game of which we write is described by Pollux, as played seventeen
hundred years since in various forms, all of which are still familiar: "The
game of 'Muinda,' when any one, closing his eyes, cries, 'Look out!' and
whomsoever he catches he makes him close his eyes instead; or when,
keeping his eyes shut, he seeks after the children who have hidden until
he catches them; or else he closes his eyes while the others touch him,
and if anybody gives a clue himself, he speaks out and guesses till he gets
it right."</p>

<p>When a bandage was used, the game was called the "Brazen Fly" (we
may suppose a gaudy species of insect, from the zigzag motion, as boys
run when chasing butterflies), and is thus described by the same author:
"The eyes of a boy having been bound with a bandage, he goes round,
saying, 'I shall chase the <i>brazen fly</i>;' but the others, answering, 'You will
chase him but not catch him,' hit him with whips of papyrus, till he catches
one of them." These papyrus whips were the equivalent of our knotted
handkerchiefs.</p>


<h3>No. 109.<br />

<i>Witch in the Jar.</i></h3>

<p>One of the children is selected for a witch, and each of the others
chooses some tree or post for a goal. The witch then marks out on the
ground with a stick as many circles as there are players, which she calls
"jars." The children run out from their homes, and are pursued by the
witch. Whenever she catches one, she puts him in one of her jars, from
which he cannot escape unless some one else chooses to free him by touching.
Once freed, he cannot be recaught until he has reached his home,
and ventures out once more. The freer, however, can be caught, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the witch keeps guard over her prisoners, it is a dangerous task for a
player to attempt to set his companions free. When all are caught, a
new witch is chosen.</p>


<h3>No. 110.<br />

<i>Prisoner's Base.</i></h3>

<p>This game is also called "Prisoner's Bars;" but the first name, mentioned
in "Cymbeline," seems the older, from which the latter has arisen
by misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The game, which is also popular in Europe, is originally an imitation
of warfare. The two armies stand facing each other, and have their <i>bases</i>
each on a line parallel with that of the adversary. But in the United States
the game has been changed, so that the two parties stand on the same line,
and the bases are placed diagonally opposite at a distance of some thirty
yards, so that each base is nearer to the enemy's forces than to those of the
side to which it belongs. The game is opened by a challenge given by
one leader to the other; each player can tag any one of the opponents
who has quitted his line before he has left his own. Any player tagged
must go to his base. Any player who can reach his base in safety may
release a prisoner.</p>

<p>As it often happens that a half-dozen runners may be pursuing a
single fugitive, who is cut off from his friends, the chase may be prolonged
far from the point of departure, through streets of the town or fields of
the country.</p>


<h3>No. 111.<br />

<i>Defence of the Castle.</i></h3>

<p>After the battle of Dunbar, Oliver Cromwell sent Colonel Fenwick
with two regiments to reduce Hume Castle. The governor, Cockburn,
when ordered to surrender, replied by quoting the following lines, which
must have belonged to a boys' game of his day:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, William of the Wastle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am now in my castle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a' the dogs in the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winna gae me gang down.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>The rhyme, with small change, is still familiar in Scotland, and the game
well known in Pennsylvania, where the defiance runs, less chivalrously,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hally, hally, hastle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come into my new castle!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or, with a change of usage,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hally, hally, hastle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get off of my new castle!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the first case the defender maintains his post against assailants; in the
latter, he endeavors to capture one of a group who have established themselves
in his castle, represented usually by a cellar-door.</p>


<h3>No. 112.<br />

<em class="gesperrt"><i>Lil Lil.</i></em></h3>

<p>This game is played in an open field. A boy stands in the centre of
the field, and the other players at the sides. With the cry "Lil lil!" they
run across. The tagger must touch a runner three times on the back,
and whoever is so caught must assist him. There is a rhyme for this
game&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lil, lil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wash my lady's dishes,<br /></span>

<p>"Lil lil!" is also a cry (in Boston) of children "coasting," when the track
is to be cleared.</p>

<p>We have not obtained information as to the manner in which this
game was played, but it is evidently identical with the Scotch rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hickety, bickety, pease, scone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall this poor Scotchman gang?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will he gang east, or will he gang west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or will he gang to the craw's nest?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the Scotch game, a boy, whose eyes are bandaged, rests his head against
a wall, while the rest come up and lay their hands upon his back. He
sends them to different places, according to the rhyme, and calls out,
"Hickety, bickety!" till they have returned, when the last in must take
his place. The "crow's nest" is close beside the blindfolded boy, and is
a coveted position.</p>

<p>This game is also played in Switzerland. Each of the children receives
the name of some animal, as Goat, Wolf, Snake, Frog, etc. To the swifter
and more dangerous beasts are assigned the more distant positions. The
keeper then shouts out that supper is ready, whereupon all rush home,
each animal uttering his own peculiar cry. The last in is punished.</p>

<i>Stealing Grapes.</i></h3>

<p>A circle of children with arms raised. Enter keeper of garden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What are you doing in my vineyard?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Stealing grapes."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This game is probably a recent translation from the German. It is also
played in Italy in a more humorous form. The thief exclaims, as he picks
each, "A delicious grape!" The guardian demands,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What did you pick that grape for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Because it's first-rate."<br /></span>

<i>Stealing Sticks.</i></h3>

<p>A company of players divide, each having the same number of sticks,
which they deposit on each side of a line; whoever crosses the line may
seize a stick, but if caught is confined in a prison, marked out for the
purpose.</p>

<p>This is the game of "Scots and English," and may be classed among
sports originating in border warfare.</p>


<h3>No. 117.<br />

<i>Hunt the Squirrel.</i></h3>

<p>A ring of players is formed, about the outside of which circles a child
who carries a knotted handkerchief, with which he finally taps another on
the shoulder, and starts to run round the ring. The child touched must
pick up the handkerchief, and run in the opposite direction from the first.
The two players, when they meet, must courtesy three times. The toucher
endeavors to secure the other's place in the ring, failing which, he must
begin again. As he goes about the circle, he recites the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hunt the squirrel through the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lost him, I found him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a little dog at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He won't bite you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He won't bite you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he <i>will</i> bite you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Cambridge, Mass.</i></p>

<p>In Philadelphia, a corresponding rhyme begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I carried water in my glove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sent a letter to my love.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A variation from New York:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I tis-ket, I tas-ket, A green and yel-low bas-ket. I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">sent a let-ter to my love, And on the way I dropp'd it.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The name of the game in England is "Drop-glove."</p>

<p>Another and apparently older way of playing "Hunt the Squirrel" is
a game in which the child touched follows the toucher until he has caught
him, pursuing him both in and out of the ring, being obliged to enter and
leave the circle at the same point as the latter.</p>

<p>A kissing-game, in which the player who makes the circuit taps another
on the shoulder, and then takes flight, while the person touched is
entitled to a kiss if he can capture the fugitive before the latter has made
the tour of the circle and gained the vacant place, is a favorite among
the "Pennsylvania Dutch," under the name of "Hen-slauch" (Hand-slag),
that is, striking with the hand. The game is there called "Ring," and
has inspired certain verses of Harbach, the nearest approach to a poet
which that unimaginative race has produced.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>In a similar game, formerly played in Massachusetts, the leader of the
game touches one of the party on the shoulder, and asks, "Have you seen
my sheep?" The first replies, "How was it dressed?" The toucher now
describes the costume of some player, who, as soon as he recognizes the
description of himself, must take flight, and endeavor to regain his place
in safety.</p>

<h3>No. 128.<br />

<i>The "Times" of Sports.</i></h3>

<p>In an account of boys' sports, it would not be proper to omit some
allusion to the custom of having a certain "time" of the year devoted to
each amusement. These "times" succeeded each other almost as regularly
as the flowers of summer, the children dropping one and taking up
another every year at the same season. This succession, which the children
themselves could hardly explain beforehand, but remembered when
the occasion came, has impressed itself on observers as almost a matter of
instinct. There was, however, a considerable degree of variation in the
succession of sports in different parts of the country, and as the practice,
though by no means obsolete, is now less strictly observed than formerly,
we cannot give any very exact details on this head. It seems, however,
that this succession was only partly dependent on the climate, and in part
inherited from the mother country.</p>

<p>Thus, in all the states from Maine to Georgia, the first "time" was
<i>marble-time</i>. In New England, the snow had hardly disappeared, when
boys began to make the necessary holes in the ground, kneeling for that
purpose on the night-frozen soil, from which the moisture was just oozing
out, to the great detriment of their pantaloons. A friend, indeed, asserts
that this was the <i>object</i> of the choice of seasons. But at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
boys in Georgia (and, indeed, in England and Germany) were playing the
same game.</p>

<p>The subsequent succession of sports in New York is indicated by the
adage, "Top-time's gone, kite-time's come, and April Fool's day will soon
be here."</p>

<p>In Georgia the succession was, kites, tops, and hoops. In that region
the season for popguns is when the <i>China-berries</i><a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> ripen. It is a provision
of Providence, a clear case of design, thinks a friend, that just at
that season the elder pith is ripe enough to be pushed out, and so leave
the stalks empty to form the barrel of the weapon.</p>

<p>Ball is especially a holiday game. In Boston, <i>Fast-day</i> (the first
Thursday of April) was particularly devoted to this sport. In England,
the playing of ball at Easter-tide seems to have been a custom of the
festival, inherited probably from pre-Christian ages. Foot-ball was a regular
amusement on the afternoon of a New England Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The invariable succession of children's sports has been also remarked
in other countries. A Swiss writer says, "The principal games of boys
belong to the first third of the year, return always in a like order, and
replace each other after an equal interval, as if it were in the natural
course of events, and without the individual child being able to say who
had given the sign and made the beginning."</p>

<p>We may remark that another American usage has been remarked in
other countries. In the last generation the boys of different towns, or of
different quarters of the same town, waged regular and constant war. In
Boston, for example, there was a well-defined line, beyond which no
"North-ender" dared be seen. Any luckless lad obliged to go into the
hostile district took good care to keep his eyes open, to dodge cautiously
about the corners, and to be ready for instant flight in case of detection.
So in France and Switzerland, where this warfare is a sort of game, a
relic, no doubt, of the ancient separatism, which made every community
in a measure an independent state. The chief weapons are stones, as
they were formerly in the United States. In the old town of Marblehead
boys were accustomed to "rock" any stranger, and no unknown driver
dared to enter its limits with a vehicle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<h3>No. 129.<br />

<i>Camping the Ball.</i></h3>

<p>In the vocabulary of a Massachusetts schoolboy, to "camp" a foot-ball
is to kick it, while held between the hands, from one side of the field to
the other. In England, country-folk speak of the "camp-game" of ball,
of the "camping-ground." In this amusement there are lines which mark
the rear limit of the respective sides, while the ball is placed in the
middle, and the object of either party is to drive it, with foot or hand,
over the enemy's line. Similar, in the United States, is the old-fashioned
game of foot-ball, in which, to use the expression of the play-ground,
two captains "choose up" sides, selecting alternately from those present,
and first play is determined by lot.</p>

<p>This description of foot-ball, or the English "camp-game," will answer
very well for a translation of the account which Pollux, writing in Greek
in the second century, gave of the "common ball," or "ball battle,"<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of
his day. Almost exactly the same was the ancient Norse game, except
that the resemblance to warfare was closer; the players were matched by
age, and played against each other in the order of choice. The balls were
heavy, sometimes made of horn, so that we read of men killed and wounded
in the encounter. In like manner, up to a very recent time, in Lower
Germany, villages contended against each other, hurling wooden balls
loaded with lead, man against man. Thus the game was really "kemping"
(<i>Kemp</i>, a warrior, champion), and the field a kemping-ground.</p>

<p>It was natural that, while the men contended, the boys also should
have their mimic sports, in all respects similar; and we read in a Saga
how the seven-year-old Egil slew with an axe his antagonist Grim, who
had very properly knocked him down for breaking a bat over Grim's head.
In those days such feats were held to presage an honorable career.</p>

<p>The Persians and Turks still practise a different sort of game, which
is played on horseback, the riders using a racket to strike with. Five or
six horsemen circle about, and strike the ball at each other; if it drops on
the ground, a slave picks it up. The ball is heavy, covered with hard
leather, and capable of doing serious harm. This game is, in fact, an imitation
of warfare, a modification of casting the "jered," or javelin. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>"Arabian Nights" recite how, while the Caliph Haroun Al-Raschid was
playing, a spy aimed a ball at him from behind, with the intent of assassination.</p>

<p>The Byzantine court adopted from the East the playing on horseback
and the racket, but introduced these into a game resembling the ancient
"ball-battle." The historian Cinnamus describes the Emperor Manuel,
in the twelfth century, as fond of this species of polo.</p>

<p>From Eastern custom we get our tennis, while most of our games
with bat and ball seem to have come down to us from the ancient
North.</p>

<p>The history of the change from actual to imitative warfare, from the
latter to a harmless and courtly amusement or to a rustic pastime, from
this last again in our own days to a scientific sport, may supply material
for serious reflection.</p>


<h3>No. 130.<br />

<i>Hand-ball.</i></h3>

<p>No doubt our Saxon ancestors had, besides the half-military exercise
referred to, other sports with the ball, better adapted to girls and children,
though no description of such has come down to us. We know,
however, that the Roman games with the ball were essentially the same as
our own. Girls still strike, as then, balls with the palm of the hand to
keep up their bouncing, or fling them against the wall to drive them back on
the return, or pass the ball from hand to hand in the ring or row. Boys in
those days, standing on the corners of a triangle, sent back the ball on the
fly or the bounce, giving with one hand and taking with the other, much
as they do to-day. The ball itself was very much the same in the time of
the early empire as now, soft or hard, plain or covered with painted or
embroidered cloth, a large hollow balloon, or a small light sphere. Children's
balls were made with a rattle inside, and divided into gaudy divisions
like the lobes of an orange, then as at present.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of a girls' game of ball is in the "Odyssey." It
is a grand washing-day in the palace of Alcinous, and Nausicaa, daughter
of the house, is to preside over the operation. So the "shining" but
soiled raiment is brought out of a storeroom, loaded on a mule-wagon, with
food, wine, and dainties, not forgetting a flask of oil for use after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
bath. When the clothes have been scoured in pits along the river-side,
and spread out to dry on the rocks by the shore, the maidens bathe, anoint
themselves, and lunch. Afterwards the ball is brought out; the game is
accompanied with song, in which the princess leads, and far excels the
rest. The party is on the point of returning, the mules have been harnessed,
and the clothes folded, when Nausicaa has a fancy for a romp;
she throws the ball at one of her damsels, but misses her aim, and the ball
falls into the eddying river, while the maidens shriek out loudly.</p>

<p>Misson (about 1700) mentions "the throwing at one another of tennis-balls
by girls" in England, as a practice of a particular season of the year.</p>

<p>The German poets of the Middle Ages abound in allusions to the game,
which is described with the same fresh poetical feeling that inspires the
whole period. It was the first sport of summer. "When I saw the girls
on the street throwing the ball, then came to our ears the song of the
birds," says Walter von der Vogelweide. A common way of playing
was for youths and maids to contend for the ball, which the possessor
then threw to the one he or she "loved the best." A minnesinger pleasantly
depicts the eager girls calling to some skilful and favorite lad, as he
is about to throw, holding out their hands,</p>

<i>Stool-Ball.</i></h3>

<p>William Bradford, the second Governor of Massachusetts, records, under
date of the second Christmas-day of the colony: "The day called
Christmas-Day, y<sup>e</sup> Gov.<sup>r</sup> caled them out to worke (as was used), but y<sup>e</sup>
most of this new company excused themselves, and said it wente against
their consciences to work on y<sup>e</sup> day. So y<sup>e</sup> Gov.<sup>r</sup> tould them that if
they made it mater of conscience, he would spare them till they were
better informed. So he led away y<sup>e</sup> rest, and left them; but when they
came home at noone from their worke, he found them in y<sup>e</sup> streete at
play openly, some pitching y<sup>e</sup> bar, and some at stoole-ball and such like
sports. So he went to them, and took away their implements, and tould
them that it was against his conscience, that they should play and others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>work. If they would make y<sup>e</sup> keeping of it mater of devotion, let them
keep their houses, but there should be no gameing or revelling in y<sup>e</sup>
streets. Since which time nothing hath been attempted that way, at least
openly."</p>

<p>Stool-ball was so named from the setting-up of a stool to be bowled at.
The ball was struck with the hand by the player at the stool. If the ball
struck the stool, the players changed places. In another form of the
game, which seems to be that referred to here, there were several stools,
men at each, and a bowler outside. When the ball was hit (with the
hand) the players must change places, and the bowler was at liberty to
hit with the ball any player while between the stools, and so put him out.</p>

<p>Bradford, as a Puritan, had perhaps some reason for his aversion to
hand-ball on holidays, seeing that it appears to be connected with ancient
religious usage. "Stool-ball" was especially an Easter-game, played by
ladies for small stakes, particularly a <i>tansy</i> or Easter-cake;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> thus we have
the name in a pretty rhyme of the seventeenth century&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>According to a curious extract from a manuscript given by Ducange,
of the diocese of Auxerre, it was an ancient custom to play in the church,
on Easter Monday, a solemn game of ball, while singing anthems proper
to the season.</p>

<p>"The ball having been received from a proselyte, the dean, or another
in his stead, he and the rest wearing the <i>almutia</i>, sang the antiphonal
which begins, "<i>Victim&aelig; Paschali laudes</i>;" then seizing the ball with his
left hand, he led the dance, the others, taking hold of hands, variously inflecting
the chorus, while the ball was delivered or thrown by the dean to
one or more of the choristers alternately, so as to weave a garland, as it
were. The game and motions were conducted according to the numbers
of the prose. The dancing having been finished, the chorus after the
dance hastened to the banquet."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>This dance was not merely a local custom, but practised in other towns.
At Vienne it was conducted by the archbishop in his palace.</p>

<p>No doubt we have here a survival of the ancient games of the spring
festival, in a day when mirth and the exhibition of physical prowess were
considered acceptable to deity, and elevated into religious exercises.</p>

<i>Call-Ball.</i></h3>

<p>This game (commonly called Callie-ball, or Ballie-callie), was formerly
a common sport of schoolboys in New England. The ball was thrown
against a house, and at the same time a name called. The lad named
must strike back the ball on its rebound.</p>

<p>We are not well informed as to the sequence, but the game in Austria,
where it is well known, goes on as follows: If the player, whose name is
called, drops the ball, he must pick it up as quickly as possible, while the
rest scatter. He then calls "Stand!" upon which the players halt, and he
flings it at whom he pleases. If he misses his aim, he must place himself
in a bent position with his hands against a wall, until every player has
taken a shot at him.</p>

<p>The delightful lines of Herrick, cited as the motto of the present
chapter, show us youths and maids playing at "call-ball;" but the game
here appears to consist simply in calling out the name of the person of
the opposite sex who is to catch the ball, as in the medi&aelig;val sport referred
to in No. 130.</p>


<h3>No. 133.<br />

<i>Haley-Over.</i></h3>

<p>The players are divided into equal parties, who take position on different
sides of a building, out of sight of each other. A lad then throws the
ball over the roof of the house, to any height or in any direction he pleases.
It is the object of the opposite side to catch the ball on its descent; and if
any player succeed in doing so, he immediately darts round the corner,
and attempts to hit with the ball some player of the other side, who scatter
in all directions. To this end, he may either throw the ball from a dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>tance,
or chase any antagonist till he has come up with him, and has an
easier mark. If he succeed in hitting a boy, the latter must follow the
former back to his own side, to which he henceforward belongs. The
game is continued until all players have been brought over to one side.
The party from which the ball has been thrown have no means of knowing
whether it has been caught or not, until its return, and must be prepared
to see an adversary suddenly appear, ball in hand, and ready to
throw. Hence the excitement of the game, which belongs to Connecticut.</p>

<i>School-Ball.</i></h3>

<p>In this amusement of New England school-girls, the ball is tossed by
the <i>teacher</i> to the head of the class, and, after being returned by the latter,
sent to the next of the row, and so on. If any girl misses, she must go to
the foot, and if the <i>teacher</i> misses, the <i>first scholar</i> takes her place.</p>

<i>Wicket.</i></h3>

<p>This exercise is an old-fashioned game resembling cricket. A peculiar,
long, shovel-shaped bat is used, flat, straight on one side and spoon-shaped
on the other. The ball is bowled at the wicket, which is defended by the
player. When the ball is struck, a run must be made to the base of the
bowler, and return.</p>

<i>Hockey.</i></h3>

<p>This sport is also called <i>Shinny</i>. The ball is struck on the ground
with a bent stick, the object being to drive it over the enemy's line.
The game is much played on the ice, as has been the case from the oldest
times in the North; for this is doubtless a descendant of the games with
bat and ball described in Icelandic Sagas. The name of "Bat and Ball,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
also given to this sport, indicates that in many districts this was the usual
way of playing ball with the bat.</p>


<h3>No. 137.<br />

<i>Roll-Ball.</i></h3>

<p>A row of holes large enough to contain the ball is made, one for each
boy. The player to whom is allotted the last hole takes the ball, stands
off, and rolls it in such a way as to stop in one of the holes. The boy into
whose place the ball has rolled seizes it, while the rest scatter, and throws
it at some one of the group; if he succeeds in hitting him, a stone is
placed in the hole of that boy; if not, the thrower must put a stone in
his own. The rolling of the ball is then repeated. When five stones
(called <i>babies</i><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>) are lodged in any hole, that boy is out of the game.</p>

<p>This New England game is exactly paralleled in Switzerland and
Austria.</p>

<i>Hat-Ball.</i></h3>

<p>This is the same game as the preceding, played (among the Pennsylvania
Germans) with <i>hats</i> instead of <i>holes</i>. The ball is tossed into the hat
of the player who is to begin. The first to get five stones in his hat loses,
and must undergo the punishment of being "paddled," passing under the
legs of the row of players for that purpose.</p>

<i>Corner-Ball.</i></h3>

<p>This is also an old game kept up by the Pennsylvania Germans&mdash;Pennsylvania
Dutch,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> as they are commonly called. Four players stand
on the four angles of a square, and the four adversaries in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The ball is passed from one to another of the players in the corners, and
finally thrown at the central players. For this purpose the following
rhyme (which our readers may translate if they can) is used by the boy
who aims the ball at the players in the centre. These last, if they can
catch the ball, may fling it back.</p>

<i>Base-ball.</i></h3>

<p>It is only within a few years that Base-ball has become the "national
sport" of America. The present scientific game, which we naturally
do not intend to describe, was known in Massachusetts, twenty years
ago, as the "New York game." A ruder form of Base-ball has been
played in some Massachusetts towns for a century; while in other parts
of New England no game with the ball was formerly known except
"Hockey." There was great local variety in these sports.</p>

<p>We may refer to some features of the old-fashioned game which possess
interest. The first duty, in games with the bat, is "to choose up."
The two best players, or any two selected, toss the bat from one to another;
the tosser places his right hand above the hand of the catcher,
who in turn follows with his own left, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> He who can get the
last hold has first choice; but the hold must be proved by ability to whirl
the bat three times round the head, and throw it. Another test of a sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>grasp is for a player to hammer with a second bat on the hand
which is uppermost. In this last case, therefore, the grasp must be low
enough for the wood of the bat to be struck by the blow.</p>

<p>In this game there were three "bases" besides the "home" base, at
about the same distance as at present; but the number of players was
indeterminate. The pitcher threw the ball, and the catcher stood close
behind the striker. When the batsman struck the ball, a run must be
made; and the ball was not, as at present, thrown <i>to</i> the base, but <i>at</i> the
runner, usually with all the force possible. If he was hit, he was out;
and each member of the side had to be put out separately. There were,
moreover, ways in which a side could recover its lost players. When all
were out but one, who was on one of the bases, the pitcher and catcher,
approaching to within some thirty feet, tossed the ball to and fro, and the
runner must "steal" his next base, while the two former watched his
movements, ready to throw to the nearest fielder of their side, who in turn
would hurl the ball at the remaining player. If under these circumstances
he could reach home untouched, he might "put in" any player of his
side.</p>

<p>As there was never any umpire in these games, the field for controversy
was unlimited. One way, as we recollect, of settling disputes was
as follows: All proceeding to the spot of the doubtful catch, the best
player on one side hurled the ball with all his force upwards; if it was
caught by the designated player of the other party, the point was given
in the latter's favor, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>We need only mention the game of "Old Cat," in which there are
two goals&mdash;the striker's and the pitcher's&mdash;and the run is made from the
former to the latter and return. The game is then named from the number
of batters, "One Old Cat," or "Two Old Cat."</p>

<i>Marbles.</i></h3>

<p>We do not intend to describe the various games of marbles, which
might probably fill a small volume. Of these there are two principal
types. One consists in striking the marbles out of a ring, by shooting
from a line, or <i>taw</i>, drawn as a limit; the other, in making the tour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a series of holes made for the purpose. Whoever first gets back to the
starting-point, or taw, wins.</p>

<p>The first of these games may be descended from a sport of Roman
children, mentioned by Ovid, and still in existence, in which nuts are
rolled down an inclined plane, with the object of striking the nut of the
adversary. The second seems to be the childish reduction of a game with
the ball, similar to "Golf."</p>

<p>Extensive is the lore of marbles. When a lad wishes to change his
position, so that, while preserving the same distance from his mark, he
may have a more favorable position, he exclaims, "Roundings." If, however,
his antagonist is quick enough, he will cry "Fen [defend] roundings."
The game, when played to win the marbles of the opponent, is said to be
"in earnest." If any accident happens, and the opponent's play is to be
checked, a Georgia lad will say "King's excuse." That this is an ancient
phrase is shown by the corruption of the same cry in Pennsylvania,
"King's scruse." Under certain circumstances a boy who puts down a
second marble is said to "dub" (double) a marble, or to play "dubs."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<i>Cat.</i></h3>

<p>The "cat" is a little billet of wood, about four inches long, and pointed
at the ends, which is to be struck with a light stick. A player stands
at a little distance, and endeavors to throw this missile into a hole or circle
previously made. Another stands over the circle, and defends it with his
stick. If the cat falls in the circle, the batter is out. If, on the other
hand, it falls out of the circle, he has the right of making a stroke.
Placing the cat within the circle, he hits it on one end with his bat;
and, as it bounds upwards, endeavors to strike it as far away as possible.
If the cat is caught, he is out; otherwise, he is entitled to score
a number, proportioned to the distance which the cat has been struck,
estimated in jumps or foot-lengths. This score, however, is subject to a
peculiar negotiation. The pitcher offers the batter a certain number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>points&mdash;as, for example, five. If this is not accepted, he raises his bid to
eight, ten, or as high as he thinks proper; but if his final offer is refused,
the pitcher measures the distance (in jumps or lengths of the foot), and if
he can accomplish it in a less number than that offered, the striker or his
side lose that number of points; otherwise, the number measured is scored.
The game is an agreed number of hundreds. This game is now played
in Hindostan, as well as in Italy and Germany.</p>

<i>Cherry-pits.</i></h3>

<p>Cherry-pits are referred to as used in boys' games as early as <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1522, and are still so used in the streets of New York.</p>

<p>The pits are thrown over the palm by the boy whose turn it is to
play; they must fall so far apart that the finger can be passed between
them. Then the player with a fillip of the thumb makes his pit strike
the enemy's, and wins both. If he misses, the next takes his place.</p>

<p>This game, like the rest, has its regular season, at which all the boys
in the neighborhood may be seen playing it.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<i>Buttons.</i></h3>

<p>Buttons are in extensive use in the sports of German children, with
whom they form a sort of coinage, each sort having a stipulated exchangeable
value. Traces of similar usage exist in the United States.</p>

<p>A common New York game consists in throwing buttons. A line is
drawn, and a hole made about twelve feet off. The players toss their
buttons, and whoever comes nearest the hole has the first shot. He endeavors
to drive the buttons of the rest into the hole, striking them with
the extended thumb by a movement of the whole hand, which is kept
flat and stiff. When he misses the next takes his turn, and so on. Whoever
drives the adversary's button into the hole wins it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>Another game, for two players, is called "Spans." The buttons are
cast against the wall, and if a player's button falls within a span of the
adversary's, he may aim at it and win it by striking as before.</p>


<h3>No. 145.<br />

<i>Hop-Scotch.</i></h3>

<p>A figure of about twelve feet in length, similar to that represented in
the diagram, is described on the ground, and selection made of a small flat
stone, having sharp edges. From a line drawn at a
distance of a few paces, a stone is tossed into No. 1,
after which the boy or girl hops on one foot into No. 1,
and kicks out the stone, which is then thrown into
No. 2. The player now hops into No. 1, and jumps
into No. 2, in such a way that one foot is in the division
2, and one foot in 1. The stone is kicked into 1, and
then out, and so on. In passing through divisions 1
and 2, 4 and 5, 8 and 9, a straddle must be made, one
foot being placed in each; in the others a hop only
mast be taken. A failure to throw the stone into the
right place, or to kick it into the right division, or
leaving it on any line, or touching the raised foot, or
stepping on a line, puts out, and the next takes his or
her turn.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/i026.png" width="286" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In other localities, no straddling step is taken, but
the player, in certain divisions, is allowed to place the stone on his foot,
and so expel it from the figure at a single kick; the compartments also
vary in number and arrangement.</p>

<p>This is one of the universal games, common from England to Hindostan.
Everywhere the game consists in describing on the soil an oblong
figure with several divisions, and in tossing a flat stone or potsherd into
them, and then kicking it out with a hopping motion; the arrangement
of the divisions differs. From the shape of the last compartment, the
game is called in Italy "The Bell," and in Austria "The Temple." In
Italy the three last divisions are the <i>Inferno</i>, <i>Purgatorio</i>, and <i>Paradiso</i>.
In New York the last is called <i>Pot</i>.</p>

<i>Duck on a Rock.</i></h3>

<p>We will suppose a party of boys to be debating what game to play.
"What shall we play?" "Duck on a Rock," suggests one. The idea is
instantly taken up. "My one duck," cries some boy. "My duck," shouts
a second, seizing a stone. The last to "speak" gets no duck, and has to
guard the "drake." The drake is a good-sized stone, which is placed on
an elevated position, or boulder, if such be at hand. The "ducks" are
stones about the size of the fist. The object is to knock the drake off the
rock. After each player has thrown his duck, and missed, he must recover
it. The guardian stands by the "rock," but cannot tag a player until the
latter has touched his own duck, when he must replace the keeper. Meanwhile,
if the drake is knocked off the rock, the keeper must replace it
before he can tag any one, and this is therefore the signal for a rush to
recover the thrown ducks. The game is not without a spice of danger
from these missiles.</p>

<i>Mumblety-peg.</i></h3>

<p>In this game of boys and girls, a knife is cast to the earth, on a piece
of turf, with the point downwards, and must remain sticking there; there
are several successive positions of throwing, as follows: (1) the knife is
held in the palm, first of the right and afterwards of the left hand, point
outward, and thrown so as to revolve towards the player; (2) it is rested
successively on the right and left fist, with the point uppermost, and
thrown sideways; (3) the knife is pressed with the point resting on each
finger and thumb of both hands in succession, and cast outwards; after
this it is held by the point, and <i>flipped</i> (4) from the breast, nose, and each
eye; (5) from each ear, crossing arms, and taking hold of the opposite ear
with the free hand; (6) over the head backwards. If the knife does not
"stick," the next player takes his turn; the first to conclude the series
wins. The winner is allowed to drive a peg into the ground with three
blows of the knife, which the other must extract with his teeth, whence
the name, "Mumblety-peg." Another title is "Stick-knife."</p>

<i>Five-stones.</i></h3>

<p>Such was the title of the common game in a New England town (Salem,
Mass.).<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The same amusement, under the same name, was popular
in Greece more than two thousand years ago, being mentioned as a girls'
game by Aristophanes. It is thus described by Pollux: "The game of
'five-stones;' little stones, pebbles, or bones are thrown up, so as to catch
them on the back of the turned hand, or if not all are caught, the rest
must be picked up with the fingers, while the others remain on the
hand."</p>

<p>A pleasing painting in the Museum of Naples represents goddesses
playing at "Five-stones." Agla&euml; is looking on; three of her bones lie on
the ground, one is pressed by her thumb, the fifth is hidden by her garments.
Hile&aelig;ra has just thrown; she has caught three, the other two
are falling to the ground. Niobe, Latona, and Ph$oelig;be are standing behind.</p>

<p>One of the movements of the Spanish game is still exactly the same
as that described by the Greek writers of the second century. The game
in America, as played in the childhood of the writer, also began with
catching the stones on the back of the hand, at first one only out of the
five tossed up, then two, three, four, and, finally, the whole five.</p>

<p>The game now consists of an indefinite number of figures, of which
the names and arrangements vary in different localities. In all those described
below, a single stone is tossed up, to be caught in the palm, and
while this is in the air the others must be taken into the hand, or certain
motions made.</p>

<p><i>Ones, twos, threes, fours.</i>&mdash;The stones are rolled on the table or floor,
either directly from the right hand, or over the back of the left hand resting
on the table. A single stone being selected and tossed in the air, as
above mentioned, the rest must be picked up; in the first figure one at a
time, in the second by groups of two, in the third by three and one, and
finally the whole four together. In case of an error, the next takes his
turn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Jumping the Ditch.</i>&mdash;The four stones remaining, after one has been
chosen, are placed in a line; the first and third of the row are then to
be caught up together, and afterwards the second and fourth.</p>

<p><i>Knock at the Door</i>, <i>Strike the Match</i>, <i>Wash the Clothes</i>, etc.&mdash;A
selected stone being thrown up, motions corresponding to the title are
to be made on the floor while it is in the air.</p>

<p><i>Set the Table.</i>&mdash;Four stones are placed in a heap, as if to represent a
pile of plates. One of these is taken from the heap, in the usual manner.
It is then held between the thumb and palm of the right hand, and, with
a second toss of the chosen stone, is deposited on the floor at the corner of
an imaginary square. The square having been completed by four stones,
motions are made to indicate the arrangement of the glasses, etc. <i>Clear</i>
<i>the Table</i> is the reverse movement, in which the stones are again brought
to the centre.</p>

<p><i>The Well.</i>&mdash;The left hand is laid on the table with the thumb and index
finger joined. Into the opening so formed the four stones are pushed,
by a fillip of the finger. The hand is then removed from the table, and
the stones must be caught up together as they lie. The figures vary, according
as the thumb and index are made to form an arch or circle, are
laid on the table or floor horizontally, or in an upright position, or, finally,
as the hand is raised above the table in the form of a cup. These varieties
receive the names of <i>Peas in the Pod</i>, <i>Doves in the Cot</i>, etc.</p>

<p><i>Horses in the Stall.</i>&mdash;The left hand is laid on the table with the fingers
extended, and four stones placed in front of the openings, representing
stalls. A stone being thrown up as usual, the four others are filliped into
the openings, and afterwards must be picked up together from the positions
in which they lie. In <i>Horses out of the Stall</i> the stones are brought out
from between the fingers, and then caught up.</p>

<p>Other movements are <i>Feeding the Elephant</i>, <i>Spinning the Wheel</i>, <i>Going
up the Ladder</i>, etc., to the number of thirty or more. Failing to catch
the stone thrown up, or not succeeding in the required motion, or touching
a stone unnecessarily, constitute errors, in which case it is often required
to go back to the very beginning of the game.</p>

<p>Instead of pebbles, little double tripods of iron, probably representing
the more ancient <i>bones</i>, are generally in use; and the fifth stone, or "jack,"
is often replaced by a ball or marble, the latter being allowed to bound
before it is caught. This usage seems to be of German origin. Sometimes
marbles are used, the "jack" being of a different color from the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and school-girls take pride in the beauty of the agates they employ for
this purpose.</p>

<p>About Boston a similar game is much played under the name of "Otadama,"
or "Japanese jacks." Seven little silk bags are filled with rice, one,
of a different color from the rest, being called the "jack." The game consists
of four parts. In the first figure, the silk bags being placed on the
floor, the "jack" is thrown up, and the other six picked up one by one, being
so deposited as to keep them together in groups of twos, so that two at a
time may be caught up, which is the next thing to be done. Then come
groups of three, four and two, and five and one, next the six together, the
bags, after being caught, being so dropped as to prepare for the following
movements. The next motion is "tattoo," which consists in throwing
up the "jack" and catching it on the back of the hand, then throwing it up
again from the back of the hand and catching it in the fingers, without
turning over the palm.</p>

<p>The second figure contains "second ones," "second twos," "second
threes," "second fours," "second fives," "second sixes." These are the
same as in the first figure, except that in each case the bags caught, instead
of being merely dropped from the hand, as before, are tossed up
together with the "jack," which last must be caught again before falling.
In the second and third figures "tattoo" follows every movement.</p>

<p>The third figure begins with "third sixes," in which, the six bags
being caught up and held tightly, the "jack" is again tossed, the six
slapped on the floor, and the "jack" caught on the back of the hand.
The second motion is "fourth sixes," which resembles second sixes, except
that the "jack" is now caught on the back of the hand. Next comes
"touch." The six bags are caught up, thrown with the "jack" into the
air, and the floor is touched with the middle finger, before catching the
"jack." After this follows "fours and threes," in which, the six bags
having been caught up, the palm is turned uppermost with the seven bags
(including the "jack"), and it is required to throw off first four at a time,
and afterwards the other three. "Pack up" is the next motion. The
six bags are caught up, compactly arranged in the palm of the hand,
and must be thrown up and caught on the back of the hand. Two
chances are allowed. The bags dropped the first time may be tried by
themselves. Then "third ones," which is the same as "second ones," except
that, the bags being placed in a row with the "jack" at the left, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
"jack" is constantly exchanged for each bag that is caught up. "Tattoo"
follows each of these movements.</p>

<p>The fourth and last figure is done with the left hand. The palm is
turned towards the floor, upon which all the bags lie in a row, the "jack"
at the right; a bag is then picked up by the thumb and forefinger, keeping
the other fingers extended, and is tossed on the back of the hand. It
must remain there while the second bag is picked up, and is tossed off
the hand when the second is tossed on. This motion is repeated with
the other five, ending with the "jack," and the game is finished with
"tattoo."</p>

<p>The game is played by two or more. In case of an error, the next
plays; but an error in the last figure requires the player to go back to the
beginning of the game. The "jack" is often made square and somewhat
flat, while the other bags are drawn up at two ends, and have a rounder
shape. It is necessary that they should be soft and flexible.</p>

<p>This game is of Japanese origin, "Tedama"<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>&mdash;that is, "Hand-balls"&mdash;being
its proper name. As the specimen given shows, it closely resembles
the ancient game of "Five-stones." We are informed, on Japanese authority,
that stones are habitually used by boys in playing, and that the
number of these varies. There can be no doubt that the two forms of
this amusement are branches of the same root; and we thus have an
example of a game which, having preserved its essential characteristics
for thousands of years, has fairly circumnavigated the globe, so that the
two currents of tradition, westward and eastward, from Europe and Asia,
have met in America.</p>

<h3>No. 149.<br />

<i>Counting Rhymes.</i></h3>

<p>There are various ways in which children decide who shall begin in a
game, or, as the phrase is, be "it."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> When this position is an advantage,
it is often determined by the simple process of "speaking first." So
far as can be determined when all are shouting at once, the first speaker
is then entitled to the best place. Otherwise it is the practice to draw
straws, the shortest gaining; to "toss up" a coin, "heads or tails;" or
to choose between the two hands, one of which holds a pebble.</p>

<p>The most interesting way of decision, however, is by employing the
rhymes for "counting out." A child tells off with his finger one word of
the rhyme for each of the group, and he on whom the last word falls is
"out."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This process of exclusion is continued until one only is left,
who has the usually unpleasant duty of leading in the sport. All European
nations possess such rhymes, and apply them in a like manner.
These have the common peculiarity of having very little sense, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>often mere jargons of unmeaning sounds. This does not prevent them
from being very ancient. People of advanced years often wonder to find
their grandchildren using the same formulas, without the change of a
word. The identity between American and English usage establishes the
currency of some such for three centuries, since they must have been in
common use at the time of the settlement of this country. We may be
tolerably sure that Shakespeare and Sidney directed their childish sports
by the very same rhymes which are still employed for the purpose.
Furthermore, German and other languages, while they rarely exhibit the
identical phrases, present us with types which resemble our own, and obviously
have a common origin. Such a relation implies a very great antiquity;
and it becomes a matter of no little curiosity to determine the
origin of a practice which must have been consecrated by the childish
usage of all the great names of modern history.</p>

<p>This origin is by no means clear; but we may make remarks which
will at least clear away misconceptions. We begin with that class of formulas
which we have marked from 1 to 13 inclusive.</p>

<p>Respecting these rhymes, we observe, in the first place, that they are
meaningless. We might suppose that they were originally otherwise;
for example, we might presume that the first of the formulas given below
had once been an imitation or parody of some list of saints, or of some
charm or prayer. A wider view, however, shows that the rhymes are in
fact a mere jargon of sound, and that such significance, where it appears
to exist, has been interpreted into the lines. We observe further, that, in
despite of the antiquity of some of these formulas, their liability to variation
is so great that phrases totally different in sound and apparent sense
may at any time be developed out of them.</p>

<p>These variations are effected chiefly in two ways&mdash;rhyme and alliteration.
A change in the termination of a sound has often involved the introduction
of a whole line to correspond; and in this manner a fragment
of nursery song may be inserted which totally alters the character of
the verse. Again, the desire for a quaint alliterative effect has similarly
changed the initial letters of the words of the formulas, according as the
whim of the moment suggested.</p>

<p>From the fact that neither rhyme nor alliteration is any guide to the
relations of these formulas, but seem arbitrarily introduced, we might conclude
that the original type had neither one nor the other of these characteristics.
This view is confirmed by European forms in which they appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
as mere lists of unconnected words, possessing some equality of tone.
Rhythm is a more permanent quality in them than termination or initial.
From these considerations it appears likely that the original form of the
rhymes of which we speak was that of a comparatively brief list of dissyllabic
or trisyllabic words.</p>

<p>Now, when we observe that the first word of all the rhymes of this
class is obviously a form of the number <i>one</i>; that the second word appears
to be <i>two</i>, or a euphonic modification of <i>two</i>, and that numbers are perpetually
introducing themselves into the series, it is natural to suppose that
these formulas may have arisen from simple numeration.</p>

<p>This supposition is made more probable by a related and very curious
system of counting up to twenty (of which examples will be found below),
first brought into notice by Mr. Alexander J. Ellis, vice-president of the
Philological Society of Great Britain, and called by him the "Anglo-Cymric
Score." Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, of Hartford, Conn., noticing the
correspondence of Mr. Ellis's score with numerals attributed to a tribe of
Indians in Maine (the Wawenocs), was led to make inquiries, which have
resulted in showing that the method of counting in question was really
employed by Indians in dealing with the colonists, having been remembered
in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Ohio (where it passed for genuine Indian numeration), and in this way
handed down to the present generation as a curiosity. Mr. Ellis has found
this score to be still in use in parts of England&mdash;principally in Cumberland,
Westmoreland, and Yorkshire, where it is employed by shepherds to count
their sheep, by old women to enumerate the stitches of their knitting, by
boys and girls for "counting out," or by nurses to amuse children. It is,
therefore, apparent that this singular method of numeration must have
been tolerably familiar in the mother-country in the seventeenth century,
since the Indians evidently learned it from the early settlers of New England.
It appears, indeed, that not only the score itself, but also its chief
variations, must have been established at that time. Mr. Ellis, however,
who has shown that the basis of these formulas is Welsh, is disposed "to
regard them as a comparatively recent importation" into England. Be
that as it may, we see that the elements of change we have described,
alliteration and rhyme, have been busy with the series. While the score
has preserved its identity as a list of numerals, the successive pairs of
numbers have been altered beyond all recognition, and with perfect arbitrariness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>It is plain that our counting rhymes cannot have been formed from
the "Anglo-Cymric score," since the latter is only in use in parts of England,
while the former are common to many European nations. Nothing,
however, prevents the supposition that they owe their origin to a similar
root. All that can be said is, that no modern language is responsible for
the practice, which can hardly be supposed to have originated within the
last thousand years.</p>

<p>Turning now to other types of formulas for counting, we see that any
game-rhyme or nursery verse may do duty for such. Of lines used solely
for this purpose, we find forms which have analogies on the continent of
Europe. Some of the childish verses so used, like the French rhyme we
have set at the head of our chapter, contain allusions which stamp them as
ancient. On the other hand, it seems that, in our own country, little
American inventions of the sort, recommended by some attractive quaintness,
have gained currency, unwritten as of course they are, from Canada
to the Gulf.</p>

<p>It appears, from foreign usage, that it was formerly common for each
game to have its own especial formula for "counting out," a practice of
which we have an example in No. 107.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_123_123" id="Footnote_123_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123_123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> This class of formulas (Nos. 1 to 8) appear to be mere variations of the same type, a
fact which does not prevent individual forms from exhibiting a wonderful permanence.
We consider as identical a class of German formulas, very wide-spread and variable, thus:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a.</i>) Unichi, dunichi, tipel-te! Tibel, tabel, domine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b.</i>) Eckati peckati zuchati me, Avi schavi domine.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(<i>d.</i>) Anigl panigl subtrahi! Tivi tavi, domini.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>e.</i>) Endeli b&auml;ndeli deffend&eacute;, Gloria tibi domine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
A rhyme quoted by Mr. Ellis from the <i>Millhill Magazine</i> (a school paper), and credited
to America, is similar:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>f.</i>) Eeney, meeny, tipty te, Teena, Dinah, Domine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
The following formulas from Transylvania are of a simpler type; the first is said to
imitate the <i>Gipsy</i>, the second the <i>Magyar</i>, speech:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>g.</i>) Unemi, dunemi, tronemi, ronemi, donemi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ronza, konza, jewla, dewla, tschok!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><br /></span>
<span class="i0">

<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i>h.</i>) Aketum, t&auml;ketum, tinum, tanum, &auml;rsak, m&auml;rsak, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
We take the latter type to be a nearer approach to the original form. All sorts of intermediate
stages can be observed from between these lists and the more complicated examples;
but we find no signs of numbers above ten, as in the "Anglo-Cymric score."
The Russian and Finnish tongues present similar rhymed lists, while many Italian rhymes
are of like origin, though disguised and extended.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<span class="i0">Ene tene mone mei, Paster Lone bone, strei,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ene fune herke berke, Wer? wie? wo? was?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
As this is but one case of identity out of many hundreds, we suppose the rhyme borrowed
from the English. There are many German rhymes beginning "Ene mene mu,"
or similarly; but the variation of the first sounds is endless: ene dene, ene tene, ene mene,
ente twente, entele mentele, ane tane, unig tunig, oringa loringa, etc.; by association or
rhyme, any nursery song may be introduced, or the first words may be dropped.</p></div>

<h3>No. 150.<br />

<i>London Bridge.</i></h3>

<p>No game has been more popular with children than this, and any summer
evening, in the poorer quarters of the cities, it may still be seen
how six years instructs three years in the proper way of conducting it.
Two players, by their uplifted hands, form an arch, representing the
bridge, under which passes the train of children, each clinging to the garments
of the predecessor, and hurrying to get safely by. The last of the
train is caught by the lowered arms of the guardians of the bridge, and
asked, "Will you have a diamond necklace or a gold pin?" "a rose or
a cabbage?" or some equivalent question. The keepers have already
privately agreed which of the two each of these objects shall represent,
and, according to the prisoner's choice, he is placed behind one or the
other. When all are caught, the game ends with a "Tug of War," the
two sides pulling against each other; and the child who lets go, and breaks
the line, is pointed at and derided. The words of the rhyme sung while
the row passes under the bridge are now reduced to two lines,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">London Bridge is falling down,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">My fair lady!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Readers may wonder why this well-known game should be classed as
<i>mythological</i>; but such a character appears in the European versions.
Thus, in Suabia, the two keepers of the "Golden Bridge" are called respectively
the "Devil" and the "Angel," and the object is to decide who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
shall be devils and who angels. In France the game is known as "Heaven
and Hell." The children who have made a good choice, after the selection
is finished, pursue the devils, making the sign of horns with fingers
extended from the forehead. In Italy, the name of the sport is "Open
the Gates." The gates are those of the Inferno and of Paradise; <i>St.</i>
<i>Peter</i> is the keeper of one, <i>St. Paul</i> of the other. The children choose
between <i>wine</i> and <i>water</i>; but when the destiny of the last child is decided,
the two girls who represent the keepers of the bridge break their
arch of lifted hands and move in different directions, followed by their
subjects, "while the cries and shrieks of the players condemned to the
Inferno contrast with the pathetic songs and sweet cadences of those
destined to the happiness of Paradise."</p>

<p>The game is mentioned by Rabelais (about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1533) under the name
of the "Fallen Bridge."</p>

<p>In German versions, the keepers are called "Devil and Angel," "King
and Emperor," or "Sun and Moon." In this latter form the game has
been one of the few kept up by the Germans of Pennsylvania, who call
it the "Bridge of Holland."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Connected with this game in Massachusetts is a curious piece of local
lore. A lady<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> recollects that, in the first years of the century, a pedler
came to her father's house in Plymouth, Mass., and, in default of three
cents change, left a "chap-book" or pamphlet of that value, called "Mother
Goose's Melodies." In this pamphlet (the first authentic mention of a
publication of that title) the song was included, in the familiar words;
but, instead of <i>London</i> bridge, <i>Charlestown</i> bridge was substituted in the
rhyme. In that form only the verses were familiar to herself and her
companions.</p>

<p>Charlestown Bridge, over Charles River, connected Boston with Cambridge
and other suburban towns, before that time only accessible by ferry
or a long detour. The bridge was "dedicated" July 17, 1786; and was,
in the eyes of the rustic population of Massachusetts, quite as important
a structure as the London erection of the thirteenth century. The project
was undertaken after a long incubation of sixty years, and not without
many apprehensions lest the vast masses of ice rushing down the river in
winter should sweep it away. The cost was fifteen thousand pounds. At
the celebration, a salute of thirteen guns was fired from Fort Hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>"almost every person of respectable character in private and public life
walked in the procession," and eight hundred persons sat down to dinner.
No wonder that its fame superseded, locally at least, that of the celebrated
structure which was so long the wonder of London, and so sacred in nursery
lore. We may thus form an idea of the importance of bridges in
earlier times&mdash;which importance, and the superstitions consequent, were
the root of our game&mdash;and also of the tendency of each town to localize
its traditions, even those of the nursery.</p>

<p>With the exception of the name, the words of the song, in the
chap-book referred to, were identical with those of the familiar English version.
We learn from another informant that these same words (this time, however,
under the proper title of London Bridge) were often used as a
dance-song at children's parties about the beginning of the century. The
dancers sat in a circle, a boy next a girl; as each verse was sung, the lad
whose turn it was led out his partner and promenaded, suiting action to
meaning. The exact verbal correspondence, and absence of the original
mode of playing, show that this version of the song, and consequently the
rhymes of the pamphlet called "Mother Goose's Melodies," were not
taken from the lips of Americans, but reprinted from English sources.</p>

<p>The version repeatedly printed in books for children is not truly popular.
It has been remodelled by the recorder, and so the original idea has
been disguised. We have, however, the pleasure of offering a genuine
English version. We add fragments of American forms, and finally a
curious text, for which Ireland is ultimately responsible. From these,
taken together, the character of the old English game can be made out.</p>

</div></div>

<p>As to the origin of this remarkable game, our citations have already
made clear that one of its features consists in a representation of the antagonism
of celestial and infernal powers, and the final decision by which
each soul is assigned a place on the one side or the other. It was universally
believed in the Middle Ages, that the soul, separated from the body,
had to cross a dangerous bridge, and subsequently undergo a literal
weighing in the balance, according to the result of which its destiny was
decided. It is in the nature of things that children, conversant with
these ideas, should have dramatized them in their sports. We see no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>reason, with the German writers, to go back to ancient Northern mythology;
nor do we find any ground for believing that our game is more
likely to be of Teutonic than Romance descent.</p>

<p>We suspect, however, that that part of the sport which relates to the
warfare of good and evil powers does not belong to the original idea, but
that a still more primitive game has taken on an ending which was common
to many amusements in the Middle Ages. The central point of the whole
is the repeated downfall of the structure. Now there is a distinct mythologic
reason for such a representation. In early times no edifice was so important
as a bridge, which renders intercourse possible between districts
heretofore separated. Hence the sanctity attributed in medi&aelig;val times to the
architects of bridges. The Devil, or (in more ancient guise) the elemental
spirit of the land, who detests any interference with the solitude he loves,
has an especial antipathy to bridges. His repeated and successful attempts
to interfere with such a structure, until he is bought off with an offering
like that of Iphigenia, are recorded in legends which attach to numerous
bridges in Europe. It is on such supernatural opposition that the English
form of the game appears to turn. The structure, which is erected
in the daytime, is ruined at night; every form of material&mdash;wood, stone,
and gold&mdash;is tried in vain; the vigilance of the watchman, or of the cock
and the dog&mdash;guardian animals of the darkness&mdash;is insufficient to protect
the edifice from the attack of the offended spirits.</p>

<p>The child arrested seems to be originally regarded as the price paid
for allowing the structure to stand. In times when all men's thoughts
were concerned about the final judgment, a different turn was given to
the sport&mdash;namely, whether the prisoner should belong to the devils or
to the angels, who wage perpetual warfare, and dispute with each other
the possession of departed souls. Finally, in quite recent days, religious
allusions were excluded, and the captive, now accused of mere theft, was
sentenced to be locked up, not in the Inferno, but in a commonplace jail.</p>

<h3>No. 152.<br />

<i>Weighing.</i></h3>

<p>Two children, linking hands, form a "basket" (each grasping with the
left hand the right wrist of the other, and with the right hand his left
wrist), in which another child is lifted, who embraces with his arms the
necks of his bearers. He is then swung to and fro, and finally made to
strike the wall. If he lets go his hold, he is called "Rotten egg," which
is regarded as a highly ignominious name.</p>

<p>This title is also applied to the child who lets go in the "tug of war"
in "London Bridge." A similar lifting in a basket (as we have been told
by one who remembered so playing in youth) formed, in Philadelphia,
part of the same game.</p>

<p>The original meaning of this exercise is made clear by an Italian counterpart,
in which it is called "Weighing." The child after being lifted is
made to jump over one of the lowered arms of his bearers, and if he escapes
from their grasp is destined for <i>Paradise</i>, otherwise for the <i>Inferno</i>.
The French usage is the same.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Weighing, to decide whether the child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>should be angel or devil, sometimes forms part, also, of the German game
corresponding to "London Bridge."</p>

<p>Another English game shows us a relic of this practice&mdash;namely, that
called "Honey-pots," from which, as usual in children's sports, the original
religious idea has disappeared. A child is lifted and swung until the hold
is relaxed, when the <i>pot</i> is said to weigh so many pounds.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Other tests used in German games to decide whether a child shall be
an angel or not, are&mdash;tickling, in which a sober face must be kept; jumping
over a cord, or measuring the height. These customs of play are
surviving forms of usages once equally common in English sports.</p>


<h3>No. 153.<br />

<i>Colors.</i></h3>

<p>A.&mdash;A row of children, on the doorsteps of a house, or against a
chamber wall. Opposite each other stand two girls, representing, one the
good, the other the bad, angel. Every child selects a color. The mother
stands at the foot of the steps. The "Good Angel" knocks at the door
(<i>i.e.</i>, the side of the flight of house-steps), and is answered by the mother:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who's knocking at the door?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Angel with the Golden Star."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What do you want?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Blue" (or any color).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "Good Angel" names a color. If this color is represented among the
children, the angel takes the child, but if the application is unsuccessful,
must retire, whereon the "Bad Angel," or the "Angel with the Pitchfork,"
comes forward in like manner. When all the children are divided,
a "tug of war" ensues, as in "London Bridge."</p>

<p>This form of the game is probably a recent translation from the German,
by New York children.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>B.&mdash;In the convent-school of Savannah, Ga., as we learn from a former
pupil, birds instead of colors represented the children, and the formula
was, "Barn, barn,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> who comes here?" It was replied, "Good angel," or
"Bad angel." The angels then "fought and tried to get the child."</p>

<p>C.&mdash;In Philadelphia there is a game in which the children, having
received birds' names, are pursued by the mother, and, if captured, are put
into the slop-bowl; otherwise, into the sugar-bowl.</p>

<p>Similarly, in a Swiss game, we have the mother and a bird-catcher.
The latter endeavors to guess the titles of the children, who are called
after birds or colors. When the name of a child is guessed, she takes
flight, and if she can escape, returns to the mother; if caught, she belongs
to the pursuer, and the game ends with a "tug of war."</p>

<p>Corresponding is the French game of "Animals." The devil and a
purchaser are first chosen. The seller names the animals, and shuts them
up in an enclosure. The devil, who has not heard the naming, comes
up<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and guesses the title of the beast. If he guesses right, the seller
says "Go!" while the animal makes a circuit to return to his den. The
devil must first buy (with so many taps on the palm of the hand of the
dealer) the beast, before he can pursue. If he catches the latter, he
marks him with three blows on the head and tail, and the animal becomes
the devil's dog. The game finishes when all the animals have been so
captured.</p>

<p>The conflict which ends this game is curious. In Switzerland, the
angel who obtains a child carries it in his arms within his limit, and the
devil similarly. After all the children are divided, a struggle begins, the
devils defending themselves with claws, the angels with wings. In Austria
the boundary between Heaven and Hell is marked out by a piece of
wood, called "Fire." Each child grasps the waist of his predecessor with
both arms, the leaders join hands over the "Fire," and the contest lasts
until all are pulled to one side or the other.</p>

<p>These battles between opposing supernatural forces rest on a basis
older than Christianity. The "Game of the Shell" is thus described by
Pollux: "The shell-game; where the boys draw a line on the ground
and choose sides, one side selecting the outside of a shell, the other the
inside. One who stands on the line having thrown up the shell, whichever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>face comes uppermost, those who belong to that give chase, and
the other party turn and fly. Any fugitive who gets caught is called
the <i>ass</i>. He who pitches the shell says, 'Night, day;' for the outside is
smeared with pitch, and signifies night; whence this boys' game is also
called the 'turning of the shell.'"</p>

<p>The word <i>ass</i> here means that the boy caught had to carry home his
pursuer on his back.</p>

<p>Plato alludes to this game in the "Republic," saying of the efforts of
the soul to pass from the realm of darkness to that of light, "it does not
depend on the turn of a shell."</p>

<p>We thus see the successive mental conceptions of antiquity, the Middle
Ages, and modern time reflected in the changes of children's sports.</p>


<h3>No. 154.<br />

<i>Old Witch.</i></h3>

<p>A.&mdash;Ten girls, a mother, a witch, and eight children&mdash;namely, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and the eldest
daughter Sue. The mother, preparing to go out, addresses her children:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now all you children stay at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be good girls while I am gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no one in<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><br /></span>

<hr class="tb" />
<span class="i0">Especially you, my daughter Sue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else I'll beat you black and blue.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The witch knocks at the door, and is refused entrance by the children.
She beguiles them by promises to admit her, which they finally do.
She then holds out her pipe (a bit of stick), which she carries between her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>teeth, saying to Sue, "Light my pipe!" Sue refusing, she makes the same
demand to each child, in the order of the days of the week, in which they
are ranged. All refuse till she reaches the last, who consents and touches
her pipe, whereupon the witch seizes her hand, and drags her out of the
house to her "den."</p>

<p>The mother then returns, counts the children, and Sue is questioned
and punished. This is played over until each child is taken, Sue last.</p>

<p>When the mother has lost all her children, the witch calls, and invites
her to dinner. Upon going to the witch's door, she finds a table set for
the meal, and the witch asks her to order a dish to suit her taste. She
does so, whereupon the witch produces Sunday, and lays her upon the
table, with considerable assistance from Sunday.</p>

<p>A very amusing dialogue now ensues between the witch and the
mother. The former urges the mother to eat, with many blandishments,
and the mother (recognizing her child) declines, with such excuses as any
ingenious child can devise.</p>

<p>The mother, upon pretence of inability to eat the food, calls for another
dish, and, when the witch leaves the room, hurries the child from the
table and places her behind the chair. When the witch returns, she says
that she found the dish so good that she ate it all, and calls for another.</p>

<p>Each child is produced in turn, with the same result. When all are
arranged behind their mother, she calls for another dish, and when the
witch leaves the room to get it, runs home with all her children.</p>

<p>Mother beats servant, but recovering from her loss, goes out again.
Witch enters as before, and carries off successively all the children, and at
last the servant. Witch then puts the children in a row, cooks them, and
makes them into pies, naming them apple-pie, peach-pie, etc. Mother
goes out to buy pies.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Mother</i> [<i>to Witch</i>]. Have you any pies?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">who brought you here? [<i>Beats her, and sends her home.</i>]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mother proceeds in the same manner, and brings to life the other
children.</p>

<p>C.&mdash;The name of the witch in this variation is "Old Mother Cripsy-crops,"
and the game begins by playing No. 89. When the mother goes
out, the children call after her, "Old mother, the kettle boils." She
answers, "Take a spoon and stir it." "We haven't got any." "Buy
one." "We have no money." "Borrow," says the mother. "People
won't lend," reply the children.</p>

<p>The witch comes in, and entices Sunday away by fine promises. When
the mother comes back, she inquires, "Where's my Sunday?" The children
make some excuse, as, "Perhaps he has gone down cellar," etc. She
tells Tuesday to take care of Monday, as she had previously placed Monday
in charge of Sunday, and goes out again, when the same scene is repeated,
until all the children have been carried off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>The mother now calls at the witch's house, and asks to be let in. The
witch refuses, saying, "No, your shoes are too dirty." "But I will take
off my shoes." "Your stockings are too dirty." "Then I will take off
my stockings." "Your feet are too dirty." "I will cut off my feet."
"That would make the carpet all bloody." "But I must see my children,
and you have got them." "What should I know about your children?
But if you like you may call to-morrow at twelve."</p>

<p>The mother departs, and as soon as she is gone the witch goes to the
children and renames them all. One she calls Mustard, another Pepper,
another Salt, another Vinegar, etc. Then she turns their faces to the
wall, and tells them to give these names if they are asked who they are.
The mother calls again at the house of the witch, and this time is admitted.
She asks the children what their names are, and they all answer as
they were instructed by the witch. She then asks the first child to let
her feel his toe. He puts up his foot, and when the mother feels it she
says, "This is my Sunday! let your big toe carry you home;" whereupon
he runs off. The same process is gone through with all the other
children.</p>

<p>D.&mdash;To the mother (this time present), in the midst of her children,
approaches the witch, who comes limping, leaning on a cane. The dialogue
is between mother and witch.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There's old mother Hippletyhop; I wonder what she wants to-day?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I want one of your children."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Which one do you want?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The witch names any child of the row.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What will you give her to eat?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Plum-cake" (a different delicacy for each child).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The witch carries off the child, and observes: "Walk as I do, or else I'll
kill you." She takes the child home and kills her, then returns for another.
When all are gone the mother goes out to look for her children.
She goes to the witch's house, and finds all the children (presumed to be
dead) against the wall, making the most horrible faces. She points to a
child, and asks, "What did [Mary] die of?" "She died of sucking her
thumbs" (naming the child's gesture). Suddenly all the children come
to themselves, and cry out, "Oh, mother, we are not dead!"</p>

<p class="right"><i>Portsmouth, N. H.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;In a fifth version, which we have failed to obtain in full, the witch
changed the children into birds; and the mother, in order to recover
them, must guess the name of the bird. Colors, instead of birds, were
also used to represent the children.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;We have already spoken of the old English game of "Honey-pots"
as an imitation of "Weighing." This trait, however, as might be
supposed from its insignificant character, is a mere fragment of the original.
In London (as we learn from an informant of the laboring class,
who remembers taking part in the amusement), a child as market-woman
arranges the rest in a row to indicate honey-pots, each with its specific
flavor. While she is busy at one end of the row, a thief comes in and
steals a pot from the other end. This process is repeated, until all the
pots are taken. The dealer then goes out to buy honey-pots, and recognizes
her own by the flavor, so recovering the stolen goods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This game without doubt is the most curious of our collection, both
on account of its own quaintness, and because of the extraordinary relation
in which it stands to the child's lore of Europe. We have, in a note,
endeavored to show that our American versions give the most ancient
and adequate representation now existing of a childish drama which has
diverged into numerous branches, and of which almost every trait has set
up for itself as an independent game. Several of these offshoots are centuries
old, and exist in many European tongues; while, so far as appears,
their original has best maintained itself in the childish tradition of the
New World.</p>

<p>Among a great number of German forms, only one (from Suabia)
nearly corresponds to ours, with the exception of a corrupted ending.</p>

<p>In this childish drama a mother has many children, who sleep. In
her absence comes "Old Urschel" with her two daughters, the "Night-maidens"
(a sort of fairies), who steal three children, and carry them off
to their cave (hiding them behind their extended dresses). The mother
visits Urschel's abode to complain of the theft, but the "Night-maidens,"
with deprecating gestures, deny any knowledge of the lost. The action
is then repeated, the eldest daughter (who plays the same part as in our
first version) being taken last.</p>

<p>When the mother's complaints are useless, she becomes a witch. The
next day Urschel takes her stolen family for a walk. The mother comes
up and pulls the dress of a child; by her magic art all feel it at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
time, and cry to Urschel, "Oh, mother, somebody is pulling my gown!"
The latter replies, "It must be a dog." The mother then asks and obtains
leave to join the party, but endeavors to bewitch (or disenchant) her
children, who cry, "The Witch of London!" and scatter, but are captured
by the latter and turned into witches.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>In Sweden the mother is called "Lady Sun." An old woman enters,
propped on a cane, goes to Lady Sun's house and knocks. "Who is that
knocking at my door?" "An old woman, halt and blind, asks the way to
Lady Sun; is she at home?" "Yes." The old woman points out a
child, and asks, "Dear Lady Sun, may I have a chicken?" She is refused
at first, but by piteous entreaties obtains her wish, and returns, until all
the "chickens" are carried off. "She was not so lame as she made
believe," says Lady Sun, looking after her.</p>

<p>The antiquity of our game is sufficiently attested by the wide diffusion
of many of its comparatively recent variations. We remark, further, that
the idea of the child-eating demon, so prominently brought forward in our
American versions, is a world-old nursery conception. The ancients were
well acquainted with such feminine supernatural beings. "More fond of
children than Gello," says Sappho, referring to an imaginary creature of
the sort. The most ancient view of this passion for stealing children was,
that it was prompted by the appetite. Tales of ogres and ogresses, who
carried off and devoured young children, must have been as familiar in
the Roman nursery as in our own.</p>

<p>The trait of <i>limping</i>, characteristic of "witches" in games, is equally
ancient. That such demons are defective in one foot is expressed by the
ancient Greek name "Empusa" (literally One-foot), to whom was attributed
an ass's hoof, a representation which contributed to the medi&aelig;val
idea of the devil. A child's game, in which a boy, armed with a knotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>handkerchief, pursues his comrades, hopping on one foot, is known in
France as "The Limping Devil."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> This game existed also in ancient
Greece.</p>

<p>The reanimation and recovery of the children, with which the American
performance closes, is a familiar trait of ancient nursery tales.</p>


<h3>No. 155.<br />

<i>The Ogree's Coop.</i></h3>

<p>Half a century since, in eastern Massachusetts, it was a pastime of
boys and girls for one of the number to impersonate an <i>Ogree</i><a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> (as the
word was pronounced), who caught his playmates, put them in a coop, and
fattened them for domestic consumption. From time to time the Ogree
felt his captives to ascertain if they were fat enough to be cooked.
Now and then a little boy would thrust from between the bars of his cage
a stick instead of a finger, whereupon the ogree would be satisfied of his
leanness.</p>


<h3>No. 156.<br />

<i>Tom Tidler's Ground.</i></h3>

<p>A boundary line marks out "Tom Tidler's Ground," on which stands
a player. The rest intrude on the forbidden precinct, but if touched must
take his place. The words of the challenge are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm on Tommy Tidler's ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picking up gold and silver.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or, dialectically, "<i>Tickler's</i> not at home."</p>

<p>This Eldorado has many different local names&mdash;<i>Van Diemen's land</i>
in Connecticut; <i>Dixie's land</i> in New York, an expression which antedates
the war; <i>Judge Jeffrey's land</i>, in Devonshire, England; <i>Golden Pavement</i>,
in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Southern States, "Tommy Tidler's Ground" is the name of the
spot where the rainbow rests, and where it is supposed by children that
a pot of gold is buried. A highly intelligent Georgian assures us that as
a boy he has often searched for the treasure, but could never find the spot
where the rainbow touched the ground.</p>

<p>"Tommy Tidler" represents the jealous fairy or dwarf who attacks
any who approach his treasure.</p>


<h3>No. 157.<br />

<i>Dixie's Land.</i></h3>

<p>This is a variety of the last game, in which a monarch instead of a
fairy is the owner of the ground trespassed upon. A line having been
drawn, to bound "Dixie's Land," the players cross the frontier with the
challenge:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On Dixie's land I'll take my stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And live and die in Dixie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king of Dixie's Land endeavors to seize an invader, whom he must
hold long enough to repeat the words,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ten times one are ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are one of my men.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All so captured must assist the king in taking the rest.</p>

<p>The word "man" seems to be used in the ancient sense of subject, as
in the Scotch formula, where one boy takes another by the forelock (a
reminiscence of serfdom), saying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tappie, tappie, tousie, will you be my man?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The game is played in much the same manner in Germany, with a
rhyme which may be translated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">King, I'm standing on your land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I steal your gold and silver-sand.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<h3>No. 158.<br />

<i>Ghost in the Cellar.</i></h3>

<p>One of the children represents a ghost, and conceals himself in the
cellar. Another takes the part of a mother, who is addressed by one of
her numerous family:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mother, I see a ghost."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It was only your father's coat hanging up."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mother goes down with a match. Ghost appears. Terror and flight.
Whoever is caught becomes the ghost for the next turn.</p>

<p>A similar game is played in London, called (we are told) "Ghost in
the Copper."</p>

<p>The original of the "ghost" appears in the corresponding German
game, where we find in his stead the "evil spirit," who haunts the
garden.</p>


<h3>No. 159.<br />

<i>The Enchanted Princess.</i></h3>

<p>This interesting European game, though never naturalized in this
country, has been occasionally played as a literal translation from the
printed French. A little girl raises above her head her frock, which is
sustained by her companions, who thus represent the tower in which she
is supposed to be confined. The "enemy" comes up, and asks, "Where is
pretty Margaret?" The answer is, "She is shut up in her tower." The
"enemy" carries off one by one the stones of the tower (leads away, that is,
the girls who personate stones), until one only is left, who drops the frock,
and flies, pursued by Margaret, who must catch some one to replace her.</p>

<p>The celebrated French song begins, "Where is fair Margaret, Ogier,
noble knight?"<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> "Ogier" is none other than Olger the Dane, hero of
medi&aelig;val romance. The childish drama is one form of the world-old history
of a maiden who is delivered by a champion from the enchanted
castle. In the territory of Cambrai, she who is shut up in the tower is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>said to be "the fair one with the golden locks." We consider the following
number to be a variation of the same theme.</p>


<h3>No. 160.<br />

<i>The Sleeping Beauty.</i></h3>

<p>About fifty years since, in a town of Massachusetts (Wrentham), the
young people were in the habit of playing an exceedingly rustic kissing-game.
A girl in the centre of the ring simulated sleep, and the words
were&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a young lady sat down to sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wants a young gentleman to wake her up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mr. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; shall be his name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The awakening was then effected by a kiss.</p>

<p>The same game comes to us as a negro sport from Galveston, Texas,
but in a form which shows it to be the corruption of an old English
round:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here we go round the <i>strawberry bush</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This cold and frosty morning.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here's a young lady sat down to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This cold and frosty morning.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She wants a young gentleman to wake her up,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This cold and frosty morning.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Write his name and send it by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This cold and frosty morning.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mr. &mdash;&mdash; his name is called,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This cold and frosty morning.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Arise, arise, upon your feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This cold and frosty morning.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some unintelligible negro rhymes follow.</p>

<p>The refrain of the last version indicates that it is of old English
origin, and was used as a May-game.</p>

<p>It would appear, from the character of the round, that various names
are proposed to the sleeping girl, which she rejects until a satisfactory one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
is presented. At all events, this is the case in a Proven&ccedil;al game which
we take to be of the same origin as ours. In this game it is explained
that the girl is not asleep, but counterfeiting death. "Alas! what shall
we give our sister? N. N. to be her husband."</p>

<p>A favorite French round describes the maiden as asleep "in the
tower." The pretty song represents her as awakened by the rose her
lover has left upon her breast. Though there is no very close resemblance
between this and the Proven&ccedil;al game, the same idea of deliverance
from enchantment appears to underlie both.</p>

<p>We infer, therefore, that the game, apparently so natural an invention,
originally represented some form of the world-wide story of the "Sleeping
Beauty." If this be so, to explain its history would lead us to
write of Northern lay and medi&aelig;val legend; we should have to examine
the natural symbolism of primitive religions, and the loves of ancient
gods. The kissing-romp of a New England village would be connected
with the poetry and romance of half the world.</p>

<p>In any case, this interlinking of the New World with all countries and
ages, by the golden network of oral tradition, may supply the moral of
our collection.</p>

</div></div>

<p>
We have also, from an Irish domestic, a most curious account of the use of the latter
version in the town named. Agreeing, as it does, in essential respects with the character
which the European game now possesses, and which the English game once evidently
possessed, we do not doubt its general correctness; but we have had no opportunity to
verify the statement of the somewhat inconsequent informant.
</p>
<p>
An actual bridge was built up with sticks and boards, and surrounded by the ring of
players, dressed in costume; without stood the Devil. Little girls in variously colored
dresses represented the angels.
</p>
<p>
The repeated fall and rebuilding of the bridge was acted out, as described in the verses
of the song; this fall was ascribed to the malice of the Devil, who ruined it <i>during the</i>
<i>night</i> (watching it, said the narrator, from the top of an ash-tree during the day).
</p>
<p>
The imprisonment of the child enclosed by the arms of the leaders was acted out as described
in the note on page <a href="#Page_208">208</a>, but in a noteworthy fashion. A chain was taken, and
wrapped round the child, in the form of a serpent (for the Devil <i>is</i> a serpent, said the reciter);
the captive was taken to a hut (representing apparently the entrance to the Inferno) built by
the sea. Meantime, the rest of the train called on their leader for help; but he answered,
"the Devil has five feet, and thirteen eyes, and is stronger than I!" The performance
lasted five hours; and the name of the edifice was the Devil's Bridge.
</p>
<p>
In this Irish game, tests were employed to determine whether the captive should belong
to the Devil or not. One of these was the ability to walk on a straight line drawn on
the ground.
</p>
<p>
On the windows of French medi&aelig;val churches devils may be seen surrounding the
condemned with a great chain, which they use to drag them into their clutches.</p></div>

Urschelberg, where she lives, each child deposits on a certain stone two or three horn buttons
as an offering. On returning, they observe whether she has not taken them away;
and, even if the buttons remain, they are sure that she has taken pleasure in them. When
they pass a certain slope they roll down perforated stones (called "suns"), and the child
whose "sun" rolls farthest says with pride, "Urschel liked my present best."
</p>
<p>
Urschel passes for an enchanted maiden, whose original name was Prisca. Every four
centuries she plants a beech-tree for the cradle of the youth whose love is at last to release
her. The chosen shepherd sees her sitting by the road-side, in the shape of an old woman,
dressed in green gown and red stockings. But none has ever dared to wed her for the sake

<h3>COMPARISONS AND REFERENCES.</h3>

<p>The object of the following notes is to exhibit, in a clear manner, the extent of
the correspondence between the games of American children and those belonging
to children in other countries. This volume is not intended to include all games of
children, but (with some exceptions in favor of certain amusements which possess
interest as folk-lore) only such as are played with words or quaint formulas. Of
games of this class, we find in the collections very few known to children in Great
Britain, and possessing European diffusion, which are not represented in this series
by independent American versions (see No. 160, note, end). With these exceptions,
the British game-formulas to which American usage does not offer equivalents
are local and of trifling interest. The references given below may, therefore, be
considered as a comparative account of English children's games in general.</p>

<p>The coincidence which this comparison shows to exist between English and German
games is very close. Taking three German collections&mdash;belonging respectively
to Switzerland (Rochholz), to Suabia (Meier), and to Schleswig-Holstein (Handelmann)&mdash;and
leaving out of account songs and ballads, we have about eighty games
played with rhymes or formulas. Of this number, considering only cases of obvious
identity, we estimate that forty-five have equivalents in the present series, and
thirty-three are not so paralleled. But of the latter class, six are known to have
been played in Great Britain, while thirteen others appear to be variations of
types represented in this collection. Of the small number remaining, few seem
to be ancient, it being impossible to point out more than three or four really curious
games which are not played also in an English form. This agreement cannot
be explained by inheritance from a common stock, a theory which research has also
discredited in other branches of folk-lore. The relationship is only a degree less
near in other countries; thus, in a collection of Spanish games belonging to Catalonia
(Maspons y Labr&oacute;s), we find that, out of thirty-eight games, twenty-five have
English equivalents.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Carol</span>, p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>. Middle Latin <i>Choraula</i>, from <i>choreola</i>. The word <i>coraula</i> is still used to
denote the ring-dance in Switzerland; also <i>coreihi</i>, to leap (choreare), Rochholz, p. 371.
Russian <i>chorom</i>, a round of children, Bezsonoff, p. 190.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May-games</span>, pp. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>-<a href="#Page_19">19</a>. Tarb&eacute;, "Romancero de Champagne," ii. 61. Puymaigre, p. 201,
"Trimazos." A. Rivinus, "De Majumis," etc., in Graevius, Syntagma (Utrecht, 1702).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Games Cited by Froissart</span> (pp. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>, <a href="#Page_35">35</a>).&mdash;The passage here rendered (with the omission
of two or three obscure names of amusements) is from "L'Espinette Amoureuse," l. 143-338,
35-47. Many of the games mentioned cannot now be recognized from the titles given.
Others, however, can be identified; thus, <i>Queue loo loo</i> (keuve leu leu) is No. 106 of the present
collection; <i>Oats</i> (avainne), No. 21; <i>Scorn or Derision</i> (ris&eacute;es), perhaps No. 61; <i>King who
does not lie</i>, perhaps No. 55; <i>Grasses</i> (erbelette), No. 42; <i>Cligne-musette</i> (Cluignette), No.
105; <i>Pince-merine</i>, according to Menagier de Paris, lxxvii., the same as <i>Pince-sans-rire</i>,
No. 77, C. <i>Playing with nuts</i>, No. 144; <i>Throwing pence</i>, etc., No. 144, B. <i>Pebbles</i> (pierettes),
No. 137, or No. 148. <i>Hook</i> (havot), perhaps <i>Hockey</i>, No. 136. <i>Mule</i>, a kind of leapfrog,
still played in Italy, <i>Salta-muletta</i>, Gianandrea, No. 30. A species of this game in
Philadelphia is now called <i>Saults</i>. Replies (r&eacute;ponniaux), a sort of <i>Hide and seek</i>, No. 105,
in which the concealed person indicates his whereabouts in answer to a call; see same
poem, l. 2653. <i>Astonishment</i> (esbahi), a game which consisted in imitating that emotion;
thus, when the horses of a party have given out unexpectedly&mdash;"I should think we were
playing at Astonishment," says one of the cavaliers, looking at the faces of the rest (Dict.
of La Curne de Sainte-Palaye, art. "Esbahi"). On the whole, the impression which the
catalogue gives us, is that the sports of a child in the Middle Ages were very similar to
those of to-day, or, perhaps we should rather say, of yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love-games</span> (p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>).&mdash;This is an old name for games representing or offering opportunity
for courtship, as "love-songs" is for ballads. We have heard both expressions in
New England, from the lips of aged persons, in whose youth they were current. See the
Gentleman's Magazine, Feb. 1738.</p>

<p>2. A variety of No. 1. Corresponding is the <i>Faroese</i> version referred to, in which the
suitors, after rejection as thralls, smiths, etc., are finally accepted as princes, with
the expression "tak vid" (literally "take with"), be welcome, which may explain
the peculiar use of the word "take" in our rhyme.</p>

<p>3. Also a variety of No. 1. Folk-lore Record, iii. 170. Chambers, p. 139 (cited).

<p>7. <i>French</i>, Celnart, p. 15, sixth round, presents verbal correspondence.</p>

<p>8. These versions belong to a game, widely diffused through Europe, in which a
"rich" mother begs away, one by one, the daughters of a "poor" mother, until
she has secured them all.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Frischbier, No. 657.&mdash;<i>French</i>, Chabreul, p. 175,
"Riche et Pauvre." Celnart, p. 382, "Oliv&eacute; Beauv&eacute; et la voisine." Ch. du
Camb., i. 77, "La Boiteuse." The celebrated song "Girofl&eacute; Girofl&agrave;" is of the
same origin. In the Canadian round (Gagnon, p. 149), and in the English rhyme,
for the sake of the dance, the mother whose daughters are begged away or stolen
is turned into a mother whose object is to marry her many daughters; so the
<i>Swedish</i> (Arwiddson, iii. 203), which presents verbal correspondence to the English
song of our collection. Arwiddson, iii. 167, game of "Rich and Poor Birds."
The first comes in limping, leaning on a cane, and with piteous gestures begs the
train of the other. By comparing No. 154, and note, it will be seen that all
the above games make up a single branch of the numerous outgrowths of a primitive
root, which is responsible for no small part of the amusements of youth in
Europe. Compare Nurs. Rh., No. 343.</p>

etc.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Frischbier, No. 674.&mdash;<i>Swedish</i>, Arwiddson, iii. 257.&mdash;<i>Flemish</i>,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>92. The similar <i>Italian</i> game begins, "Galota, galota," whence, no doubt, our "<i>Hulgul</i>,"
Gianandrea, No. 20.&mdash;<i>Ancient Greek</i>, Scholiast to Aristophanes, Plut. 1057,
&#960;&#8057;&#963;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#967;&#949;&#961;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#969;; "How many have I in my hands?" Suidas (10th century),
Lexicon, under &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#8049;, writes: "There is a game of the following character among
the Athenians: Having taken up a number of nuts and holding out his hand, one
asks, 'How many have I?' And if [the other] guesses the number, he takes as
many as he has in his hand; but if he fails to guess, he loses as many as the asker
holds in his hand."&mdash;<i>Latin</i>, given by Helenius Acron (4th century), "quot in
sunt?" See Marin, note to preceding game.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, p. 123, "Wie viel
sollen Kerner in meiner Hand sein?" Handelmann, p. 35, etc.</p>

<p>93. A child rests his head in the lap of another, while a third claps the back of the
first, keeping time to the words of the rhyme, and finally raises a certain number
of fingers; if the kneeling child can guess the number, he takes the other's place.&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>,
Marin, i. 51, No. 81. The rhyme closely resembles the English given
in the text.&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Imbriani, No. 30, where the question is, "How many horns
do I hold up?"&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, pp. 135, 136, where it is asked, "Wie viel H&ouml;rner
hat der Bock?" This allusion to the goat (as a leaping animal) refers to the usual
practice of riding on the back of the stooping child while putting the question.&mdash;<i>German</i>,
Rochholz, p. 434.&mdash;<i>Dutch</i>, Hor. Belg., vi. 182. The formulas differ.
Tylor, Primitive Culture, i. 67. The Latin formula of Petronius is curiously
translated by F. Nodot, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1694: "&Eacute;tant &agrave; cheval sur luy, il luy donna plusieurs
coups du plat de la main sur les &eacute;paules, disant tout haut en riant, Quatre cornes
dans un sac, combien font-ils? ce jeu fini," etc. Nodot remarks of his free translation,
that it is still a boys' game in France.</p>

<p>94. Halliwell, Pop. Rh., p. 116, "Handy-Dandy."&mdash;<i>German</i> (Austria), Vernaleken,
p. 41. The formula is the exact counterpart of the English: "Windle, wandle, in
welchen Handle, oben oder unt?" Handelmann, p. 35 (Schleswig-Holstein), "Where
dwells the smith? Above or below?"&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, Marin, p. 50, No. 77.</p>

<p>95. <i>German</i>, Meier, p. 124, "Under which finger sits the hare?"</p>

<p>97. Halliwell, Pop. Rh., p. 125, "My Lady's lost her diamond ring."&mdash;<i>Low-German</i>
formulas exactly correspond to our "Hold fast what I give you." Thus the
North Frisian, "Biwari wel, wat ik di du," Handelmann, p. 38. Corresponding
to "Button, button, who's got the button?" is the <i>Italian</i> "Anello, anello, chi
ha mi anello?" Gianandrea, No. 14.&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, Maspons y Labr&oacute;s, p. 86.</p>

<p>98. Halliwell, Pop. Rh., p. 133.</p>

<p>99. <i>German</i>, Frischbier, p. 195.</p>

<p>100. A universal game.</p>

King and Queen of Cantelon."&mdash;<i>German</i>, Rochholz, p. 414, No. 32.</p>

<p>102. Halliwell, Pop. Rh., p. 132, "The Old Dame," like our B. The Scotch of Chambers,

Neus, p. 418, begins like the Scotch.&mdash;<i>Russian</i>, Bezsonoff, p. 195, probably
borrowed from the German.</p>

<p>103. The name, "Tag," in Gent.'s Mag., Feb. 1738.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Handelmann, p. 66, "Eisen
anfassen;" "Eisenzech" in Berlin; "Eisenziggi" in Switzerland.&mdash;<i>Italian</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>

<p>106. <i>French</i>, Chabreul, p. 1, "La Queue Leuleu," mentioned by Froissart.&mdash;<i>German</i>,
Rochholz, p. 408, etc.; Schuster, p. 392, a game of wolf and geese; so <i>Russian</i>,
Bezsonoff, p. 205.</p>

<p>107. <i>Spanish</i>, Marin, i. 169. The seeker must wait until the hiders, who go off one by
one as they are counted out, cry "Jilo bianco, jilo negro," etc. Hence, probably,
the cry "Blancalilo," etc., of the English game. The rest proceeds like No. 105.
In the Spanish sport, a player reaching goal must spit three times; this seems to have
been originally a conjuration against the Evil Spirit, whom the seeker represented.</p>

<p>108. <i>Ancient Greek</i>, Pollux, ix. 113, 123. The game is universal. See Handelmann,
p. 71. Child, Eng. and Scot. Pop. Bal., 1882, i. 67.</p>

<p>109. <i>German</i>, Handelmann, p. 65, "Die Hexe." The games are identical; yet the
children, from whom the version in the text was learned, imagined that they had
"made it up!"</p>

p. 58, "Les Barres."&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Bernoni, p. 87. The French word <i>barres</i> is probably
only a false interpretation of an older word <i>bar</i>, a form of our base, meaning
goal; so Swiss "Bahre," Basle. Kindr., p. 30.&mdash;<i>Flemish</i>, in Hor. Belg., vi. 181.</p>

<p>117. This number includes the remains of two ancient games: (a) <i>Ancient Greek</i>, &#963;&#967;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#957;&#948;&#945;,

<p>122. Variation of No. 121. The name connects it with the old English game of "Frog in
the Middle," Strutt, p. 293; the ancient Greek, &#967;&#965;&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#957;&#948;&#945;," pot-game," see p. 31, note.</p>

old cat," etc.) is explained by the Flemish "Caetsen, Ketsen," the common name
of the game of ball in the Netherlands, Hor. Belg., vi. 177.</p>

<p>141. <i>German</i>, names of "marbles." "Schnell-K&uuml;gelchen" (15th century), "Schusser,"
"L&ouml;per," also "Marmeln," the latter when made of marble. A MS. of the 15th
century mentions "the yellow glass used for the little yellow balls with which
schoolboys play, and which are very cheap," Rochholz, p. 421.&mdash;Playing marbles
(<i>kluckern</i>) in the streets was forbidden on pain of torture, by the Reformers
in Zurich, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1530.&mdash;The general name in North Friesland is "Rollkugle,"
"rollballs."&mdash;<i>French</i> name, "<i>billes;</i>" see Celnart and Bel&egrave;ze for description of
games. The game of Roman boys with nuts, from which marbles is probably
derived, is still played in the Netherlands, Hor. Belg., vi. 182. Nuts are also
used instead of marbles in Italy, Gianandrea, No. 20.</p>

<p>142. Strutt, p. 86, "Tip-cat." Brand, ii. 303, "Kit-cat." The game, which is played
in <i>Hindostan</i>, N. and Q., 4th ser. IV. 93, may probably have made its way into

<p>147. <i>German</i>, Handelmann, p. 96, "Stickmest."</p>

<p>148. Though played in Great Britain, the game is not (so far as we know) mentioned
by writers.&mdash;<i>French</i>, Celnart, p. 375 f., "Les Osselets."&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, Marin, pp. 80-95,
150-159, "Juego de las Chinas," "Game of the Stones."&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, p. 145.&mdash;<i>Japanese</i>,
Tedama, "Hand-balls."</p>

<p>149. Rhymes for counting out are used throughout Europe, and examples could be
cited of types corresponding to most of the English forms, and sometimes evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>ly
related. Peculiar is the usage in Spain, where the syllables are told off alternately
on the closed hands of a player, who holds a pebble; if the last syllable
falls on the hand containing the stone, the lad proving his fortune is free, and so
on until only one child remains. The custom has given a proverb to the language.
Marin, i. 117. A like usage (without the rhymes) we have found to be the usual
way of selection in a town of Pennsylvania (Bethlehem).</p>

<p>150. First printed in Ritson's "Gammer Gurton's Garland." Other original versions:
(1) Gent.'s Mag., Sept. 1823; (2), (3) The Critic, Jan. 15, 1857, and (4) Feb. 2, 1857.
The last mentioned is nearly identical with our B. The communicator of (1)
refers it, through an aged informant, to a lady born in the reign of Charles II.;
it has several more verses than the last, generally agreeing with our E, but lacks
the ending. The rhyme, in England, appears at present to be known as a song
only. The European rhyme is properly a dialogue, the verses being sung alternately
by the warders and the approaching party; the former, whose joined and lowered
arms represent the fallen bridge, do not elevate them until the negotiations are
concluded. The game is, no doubt, that mentioned under the name of "Coda
Romana," by G. Villani, Istorie Fiorent., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1328, ch. xcvi., as played by the
boys of Florence, in which the question put to the imprisoned player is said to
have been, "Guelf or Ghibelline?"&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, p. 101 (cited), etc. Mannhardt
in Zeitschr. f. d. Myth., iv. 301-320, gives twenty-seven versions, including
<i>Slavic</i>, <i>Hungarian</i>, <i>Scandinavian.&mdash;Swedish</i>, Arwiddson, iii. 250.&mdash;<i>French</i>, Chabreul,
p. 117, "Le Ciel et l'Enfer." Celnart, p. 52, 'Le Pontlevis.'&mdash;<i>Italian</i>,
Bernoni, p. 46, "Le Porte." Corazzini, pp. 90-93; p. 87 (a mixed form with No.
154).&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, A. de Ledesma, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1605, beginning "Fallen is the bridge." See
Marin, i. 166-168.&mdash;For the English rhyme, see also N. and Q., 1st Ser. II. p. 338.</p>

<p>The name "Lady Lee" in the song may imply a legend. We read in Nature,
June 15, 1871, p. 118: "It is not, for example, many years since the present
Lord Leigh was accused of having built an obnoxious person&mdash;one account, if
we remember right, said eight obnoxious persons&mdash;into the foundation of a
bridge at Stoneleigh." The communicator of version (2) (The Critic, Jan. 15, 1857)
spelt the name <i>Leigh</i>, and took "the Lady Leigh of the song to be the wife
of Sir Thomas Leigh, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1558, ... ancestor
of the noble family of Leigh of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire." Compare the ballad
of "The Bridge of Arta," Passow, Pop. Carmina Gr&aelig;ci&aelig; Recent., No. 511;
Tommaseo, Cant. Pop. Toscani, iii. 174 f.; F. Liebrecht, Zur Volkskunde, 1879,
p. 284.</p>

<p>151. A variation of No. 150.&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Corazzini, pp. 91-93, beginning, "Open, open
the gates." Gianandrea, No. 3, "Le Porte del Paradiso." The dialogue ends,
"Let the King of France with all his soldiers pass."</p>

<p>152. <i>Italian</i>, Bernoni, p. 54.&mdash;<i>French</i>, Ch. du Camb. i. 133.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Vernaleken, p. 55.</p>

<p>153. <i>German</i>, Meier, p, 117, "Farben aufgeben," etc.&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Bernoni, p. 51, "I
colori." This version is identical with the German and our A, as is also the
<i>Spanish</i> (or Catalan), Maspons y Labr&oacute;s, p. 91. The game of "Los Colores" is
mentioned by A. de Ledesma, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1605.&mdash;<i>French</i>, Bel&egrave;ze, p. 40 (cited).</p>

<p>Intermediate between this number and the following are games of <i>selling birds</i>,
Frischbier, p. 184; of <i>catching birds</i>, Rochholz, p. 449.</p>

<p>Greek game of the shell, &#8008;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#8055;&#957;&#948;&#945;, Pollux, ix. 111.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>154. The following is our classification of the numerous games (not before noticed as
connected) belonging to this cycle of childish tradition:</p>

<p>(1.) Versions preserving the original idea of the child-stealing witch (as in our
A, B, and C).&mdash;Halliwell, Pop. Rh., p. 131 (cited).&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, p. 117 (cited).&mdash;<i>Italian</i>,
Corazzini, p. 110, a fragment.</p>

<p>(2.) Versions in which (as in our D) the mother is represented as present, and
the game becomes one of <i>begging</i> instead of <i>stealing</i> children. This is the case in
most <i>German</i> versions. The tests described in No. 152 are introduced and become
the leading feature of the game.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Frischbier, p. 183. Rochholz, p. 436,
and p. 444, where the mother is called "Maria, mother of God," and the game "Getting
Angels." Mullenhoff, p. 486, No. 7.&mdash;<i>Swedish</i>, Arwiddson, iii. p. 437 (cited).
Mannhardt, Germanische Mythologie, pp. 273-321, gives fourteen versions, with a
long discussion of this game, and concludes (p. 297) that the last girl of the row
(who in our A is the eldest daughter, but here represents the "Mother Rose")
"personates the goddess Freya cherishing in or behind the clouds the souls of the
dead, who, renewed through the heavenly waters (the fountain of youth), are
destined to return to earth at new birth as the souls of children!"</p>

<p>It is very curious to observe that several Prussian versions contain traits only
explained by the American games, the form of which they thus imply as more
original. Thus the mother is <i>invited to a meal</i> by the witch, Frischbier, p. 182,
and the person invited sends <i>excuses</i> (see our A).</p>

<p>(3.) The mother and children are represented in childish fashion as a hen and
her brood (see our B, and No. 101). Hence the game of the "Rich and Poor
Birds;" see references in No. 8, note.&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Corazzini, pp. 86-88. Gianandrea,
No. 19, "Madonna Pollinara."</p>

<p>(4.) The children are denoted by the names of leaves or flowers.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Vernaleken,
p. 58, "Die Grossmutter." The visitor begs for a leaf as balsam to heal
her injury, and the girls are gathered under the name of leaves. So Frischbier,
p. 181. Feifalik, No. 81.&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, Maspons y Labr&oacute;s, pp. 87-89, game of "Pulling
Leeks."</p>

<p>(5.) The game has become a representation of selling pottery.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Frischbier,
p. 183. Mannhardt, p. 284.&mdash;<i>Swedish</i>, Arwiddson, iii. 169, "Selling Pots," a
dance, has become a mere mercenary transaction.&mdash;The English game of "Honey-pots"
is a version of this, where the weighing feature is to be explained as in No.
152.&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Bernoni, p. 57, "I Piteri," where the original idea reappears. The
purchaser advances <i>limping</i> (a characteristic of witches), and the game is one of
stealing and recovery (like our London version E).&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Gianandrea, No. 19.
The first part of the game is played as in (3). The "pots" are weighed, as in the
English game mentioned. Ferraro, G. Monfer., No. 43, where the purchaser is the
devil, and the game thus passes over into the form of No. 153.&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, Maspons
y Labr&oacute;s, p. 87, "Las Gerras."</p>

<p>(6.) A game of stealing or measuring cloth.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Rochholz, p. 437, "Tuch
anmessen." In this game, mentioned by the mother of Goethe (D&uuml;ntzer, Frauenbilder
aus Goethe's Jugendzeit, p. 506), the children are arranged against the wall
to represent cloth, which the dealer measures and names by the color of the stockings
of the children. A thief steals the cloth bit by bit, which the dealer must
recover by guessing the color, a task of some difficulty, the stockings having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
taken off in the interval. A very curious Low-German version, Brem. Wiegenlieder,
p. 61, removes any doubt as to the relation of the amusement to the original
game. In this version the colored cloths are only names for children. There
are verbal coincidences with forms given in the text, the dialogue beginning
"Mother, the broth is boiling over!" (as in our version B), put (as in our version
C) into the mouth of the watcher left in charge by the absent mother; so Aus dem
Kinderleben, p. 39, "Leinendieb." The remainder of the first paragraph of C
will be found almost word for word in Handelmann, p. 57, No. 80, "Frau Rosen,"
a version of the form (2).&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Bernoni, p. 55, "I Brazzi de Tela," "the
measures of cloth." The thief advances <i>limping</i>, the owner having departed,
steals the cloth, but is pursued, and the goods recovered, as in the game of pots
described above. Ferraro, G. Monfer., No. 3.&mdash;<i>French</i>, Celnart, p. 43, "La
Toile," has become a kissing romp of grown people.</p>

<p>(7.) Finally, to the same root belong various rounds and dances which represent
a mother who wishes to marry her many daughters, or of a poor widow who has
but one daughter; see our No. 8, and note.</p>

<p>155. <i>German</i>, Grimm, No. 15, "Hansel und Grethel."</p>

<p>156. Gent.'s Mag., Feb. 1738, "Fryar's Ground."&mdash;<i>Spanish</i>, Maspons y Labr&oacute;s, p. 92.&mdash;<i>French</i>,
Celnart, p. 53, "Chateau du Corbeau;" "Je suis dans ton ch&acirc;teau, corbeau,
et j'y serai toujours."&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, p. 98, "Ist der Kukuk zu Haus?" see No.
115, note. German games based on this idea are numerous. Vernaleken, p. 77,
"The Black Man;" p. 62, "Dead man, arise;" p. 73, "Wassermannspiel." The
child representing the Water-spirit lies in the dry bed of a brook and pretends
to sleep. The rest approach to tease him, when he endeavors to seize one without
leaving the brook or pit. The first so caught must assist him to capture the
rest. The superstition about a treasure buried at the foot of the rainbow is also
Swiss, see L&uuml;tolf, Sagen, etc., Von Lutzern, p. 384.</p>

<p>157. A variation of 156.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Meier, p. 121. Rochholz, p. 415.</p>

<p>158. <i>German</i>, Meier, p. 102, "Der B&ouml;se Geist."</p>

<p>159. <i>French</i>, Celnart, p. 365, etc.&mdash;<i>German</i>, Vernaleken, p. 52, etc. See Mannhardt,
Germ. Myth., pp. 492-511, who gives twenty-three versions, including a Spanish
(Catalan) one. He imagines, as usual, a good deal of mythology in the game.
The mythologic character belongs, not to the details of the children's rounds, but
to the cycle of traditions on which these are founded. The name in Suabia is
"Prinzessin erl&ouml;sen," "to disenchant the princess."</p>
